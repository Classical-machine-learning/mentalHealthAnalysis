I can see that you're all hurting and I know because I'm hurting too.  Right now I'm in an easier place but it wasn't that long ago where I wasn't.  Often we can find lots of reasons why we don't want to be here, and very few reasons that we do.  So I'm making this post to bring everyone together to either find reasons to stay or show me why you've stayed.  I don't care whether they are small or big reasons.  They are reasons.  Please feel free to post below because I want to hear yours, and I want this to be a thread where people who come here can grab onto a reason too.    The reasons why I chose to stay -  - My dogs.  - Planning to die was very complicated.  - I wanted to hold on just in case things got a little bit better.  and now, I'm glad that I stayed.  Please know that while suicide will end the pain, it will end your life too - so you'll say goodbye to any opportunities that things might get better.  Opportunities for laughter, joy and beautiful memories.  Sometimes it's about staying with the pain and finding other ways to let go of it without saying goodbye to our life.      19  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           HamSolo01     613 posts        23 March 2018

                                    in reply to romantic_thi3f     Hey romantic_theif  Your post could not have come at a better time for me  A little over two weeks ago I checked into hospital because I was feeling very suicidal. I got better and came out and made some more improvements in my life.  Yesterday and today however I have been pretty negative. I have felt very depressed and sad and lonely. Loneliness is creeping up on me a lot lately. So I wanted to check and see why so I came onto forums to have a look. I saw this post and loved it.  I think it's a great idea to make one like this.  The reasons I stay:  - family and friends would be devastated (even if my depressive mind tries to say otherwise)  - I would miss out on the rest of my life and I still have so much more to do and see  - it's a permanent solution for a temporary problem  Recently an old school friend of my younger sister suicided. Everyone was shocked. It seems that that along with other circumstances in life have led to a point now where I see that life is fragile and can be taken away so why do it myself.  I often think I don't fit in with my own generation at the age of 24 but then I remember that I conquered suicide. Twice. Part of me thinks that third time is the charm and then after that I will be truly free from this burden of depression. Who knows.  There is a great poem I sometimes remember. I want to share some of it  "The soul, denied its divine heritage in life, won't find rest in Hades either.  But if what is holy to me, the poem. That rests in my heart, succeeds. Then welcome, silent world of shadows! Once I'll have. Lived like the gods, and no more is needed."  Thanks again for your post because it cheered me up :) great idea for a thread.            Thank you for your post.      8  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           singing the blues     26 posts        23 March 2018

                                    in reply to HamSolo01     Hi I am the same the will to live is a powerful thing even if your in the ICU on a respirator as I have been ,all my life I have been dogged by the idea of suicide considering my Father did it and his father did it I thought I was cursed taking into account extreme depression and other traumas ,late last year after 20 years of no contact with any family members the police came to my door asking me to ring my sister in-law ,id forgotten I even had one ,they gave me her number and I rang my mother had passed away pretty soon I was on the phone to my brother my sister who had been trying to find me ,some had assumed I was dead ,we had about a week and a half to get re-aquainted mainly my sister and I she came and got me to spend a week with all the family as they arrived with new family's ,it wasn't easy but I made it through it I wasn't in a personal mess like a few years befor ,to cut a long story short standing beside my sister and brother at the funeral of our mother was probably the most importent thing I have ever done when my sister buckeled after looking after our mother for the last six mounths of her life I was able to hold her up as we stood in the belting down sun ,there was my answer ,this is what its all been for not any job title or amount of money any one has made but to support on another ,I havent heard much from my brother but my sister and I are as close as we used to be and have put all the past behind us .im sure my brther and I will catch up when we can we are all older and wiser now ,so its about you just dont know what is around the corner in life ,yes i struggle every day and some times i want out but I so glad I was alive to stand with them you just dont know whats around the corner in life even if it takes 20 years to manifest ,and even though my own life seems not worth living some times it is worth it so Im going to keep holding on as long as I can ,this is all new how could I do that to them now I cant i didnt know this only a few mounths ago      6  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           The Cosmos     3 posts        24 March 2018

                                    in reply to romantic_thi3f     Hey romantic_thi3f,  Whenever I feel like ending everything, I tell myself that suicide does not end the pain, it just transfer it to someone else. How could I inflict so much suffering on the people who cares about me. But most of time, I keep on going, telling myself, tomorrow will be a better day :) And life has to be so much more than the pain I'm holding right now.

                                    in reply to The Cosmos     Hi Romantic thief and readers  Wow, what great responses. So many times over the last 4 years I've hesitated typing the word "suicide". It's still a forbidden word for many of us. My brother did, my uncle did, and I wanted to in 1996.  I recall the sentence I muttered to myself that stopped me "better to be a part time dad than no dad at all". For a moment I thought of members of my family in the form of two girls a 7 and 4 yo. I left that home of emotional abuse and rebounded.  Last June I walked the eldest daughter down the aisle, she is 28yo. Had I carried through who would have done that deed? not her dad!. It was a great day.  As stated you don't know what is around the corner. How tough life can be it has its wonderful moments worth living for.  Singing the blues- you are right, those connections to family and friends can mean the world to us. For me its giving to others that filled a gap in my life from 1996 onwards. To send poems to victims of crime, to answer people desperate for answers on this forum....it fills that void, it gives value to my life.  Thankyou RT for a tremendously important topic.

                                    in reply to romantic_thi3f     Dear Romantic_thi3f~ I’m glad other people are responding in this thread, I think
it an important question.  I posted this the other day to someone else but thought it
might fit here in your thread too.  I
hope it rings a bell with someone. My apologies for the repetition.  One reason I had that kept me going was I found I did not know
myself as well as I thought. I was I was convinced my life was
meaningless, it was not going to work out, the problems were built into me, they
were my failures and so could not get better. I was full of pain, exhaustion, grief
and despair.  My circumstances looked irrecoverable.  Then I was surprised.  I had been seriously planning on taking my life, not the first time true,
but looking back I think I might have gone on, I had the means.  Then I heard a comedian I'd liked before on
the TV in the next room tell a long involved joke about false teeth and I
chuckled.  I was startled as I had no
idea I had that capability left.  A
complete surprise.  The incident helped me in a couple of ways, the joke itself kept coming
back, trying to nudge out other thoughts, and perhaps more importantly I realized I did not know all about me, and
that raised possibility my world was not as closed as I'd believed.  Later after time therapy and other things I came to look back and saw how
insidious depression was, how it counterfeited my thoughts, fooled me
completely. I was going to base my actions on this false view of the world.  Croix      6  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           PamelaR  Champion Alumni                 2640 posts        28 March 2018

                                    in reply to romantic_thi3f     Hi Romantic_thi3f  Your thread is so good! Thank you for starting it, it may help some people out there. I guess that's the purpose of the forums and these types of thread.  My own experience was many years ago, during my 20s when I was married to my first husband. I just wanted to get out of my circumstances, but also be noted as a person, a human being. I can't say the thought has never been with me since then, but I think that what keeps me from contemplating it further is:   my wonderful partner of 37 years. He'd be totally devastated and confused. He is getting old and needs someone to be there for the remaining years, as do I.  my wonderful felines. Both are so attentive, giving loads of love and chastising when I have done the right and wrong thing. They would both be horrified, mortified and fret should I not be around any longer.  life is full of joyous things. Especially nature which I love tremendously.  my friends would be completely perplexed. I have never displayed any 'suicidal tendencies' to them. My friends are lovely, caring and supportive.   So these help me to grasp onto life and everything it has to put forward. No matter how hard it becomes.  Thanks once again for starting this thread.

                                    in reply to PamelaR     Thanks RT,  I needed this outlet tonight too.  What keeps me here?   My children. Even when they drive me batty. I shamelessly guilt myself with statistics. That kids who have a parent who suicided have a higher risk of suicide themselves. It keeps me here even when I'm locked in the toilet to escape from them.  My husband. I love him. It's that simple. If I wasn't here I wouldn't get to hear him call me a mega toad ever again. And that makes me want to stick around.  That suicide solves nothing. The hurt just gets passed on. From me to those I love. More guilt. More questions. More pain.  Because like Croix said there are surprising moments. Like my daughter wearing bunny ears when we did the school pickup and all the older kids saying hello Easter Bunny and making her giggle. Moments I never want to miss.   So even if I feel crap. Even if the thoughts keep returning I can shrug and say ah well just thoughts. Doesn't mean I have to take action. Just thoughts based on pain.  Thankyou RT.      5  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           ursaic     7 posts        8 April 2018

So to be here today after about two years ...I want to ensure that I can share my stories and things I have learned through it all and so other people don't have to suffer like I did. I felt alone back then and that the walls were closing in on me back then so I don't want anyone to feel that they are alone. And that is why I am here to hopefully make a difference to someone's life.        5  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           randomx     1072 posts        8 April 2018

                                    in reply to romantic_thi3f     Hi romantic_thi3f,  My counsellor has asked me this question and I find it hard to answer.  So why am I still here?   My family and friends would be shocked and devastated. Most of them have no idea if my struggles. I don’t want to hurt them.  I don’t think that I’d succeed and I couldn’t live with the guilt and shame when everyone found out. (Selfish, I know!)   When I’m suicidal, I’m usually curled up in a ball crying or just frozen because I’m in so much emotional pain. I’m not going anywhere.  There’s a part of me that refuses to give up. I know that it’s just a feeling that will pass and things will get better. Killing myself won’t heal my emotional pain or solve my problems.

                                    in reply to romantic_thi3f     My reasons?    Im too afraid of the unknown, the pain and possible failure.  Partially also my family. Even though they make me so unhappy they'd make my death about them and go off the rails.  I think just fear. I really don't want to live but I'm scared to die.      5  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           White Rose  Community Champion                      5657 posts        9 April 2018

a part of me that refuses to give up. I know that it’s just a feeling
that will pass and things will get better. Killing myself won’t heal my
emotional pain or solve my problems.  Good thinking. I am with you there. I have gone through the pain and come out the other side, but on the road I have tried twice to leave. Obviously the universe still has a use for me.  Quercus said. That suicide solves nothing. The hurt just gets passed on. From me to those I love. More guilt. More questions. More pain. Yep, absolutely.  The biggest problem is when we are in that dark place and cannot remember those who love us, cannot remember how good the world is generally. It's all pain and darkness, guilt and shame. We need to have the ability to remember at that time. I have no idea how that works because it did not work for me. Just a free ride to hospital.  I say to anyone who has these thoughts, however minor or fleeting, don't wait until you cannot get back. Get help and leave those thoughts behind.

The thought of leaving my husband and kids and my parents behind if I took my life keep me here.  To think of how it would affect them keeps me surviving.  I also know that the world is a beautiful place but that it’s hard to see in dark moments.

I have come to realise that there are so many things in life like love and friendship and cute fluffy animals and chocolate (lol) that make life beautiful and, ultimately, worth living.

                                    in reply to Peppermintbach     What keeps me here...  Remembering that it is not my job to keep others happy and that the pressure I put on myself to do so is impossible to live up to.  Reminding myself that no matter how much of an useless failure I feel it's not true. There are people who love and need me regardless of my many flaws.  Self preservation. When I feel overwhelmed and suicide is an enormous temptation I remind myself it is my choice and noone elses. And that means I can choose to have a cup of tea and a sleep and reassess how I feel in the morning.  Regret. I know no matter how low I feel sometimes there are things I want to see and do one day. I remind myself that beyond how I feel in this moment there are future moments I want to experience.      5  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Chloe_M  Valued Contributor            836 posts        17 April 2018

                                    in reply to Chloe_M     Something to add to my previous post... It sucks that I had to work out distraction and coping tools by visiting a psych.  Someone at Uni today asked me how I was. I said that "not real good". We went to a table outside the building and had a discussion about MI. It turns out that in his past life (years ago) also had MI problems. In this discussion I mentioned some of the distraction and coping tools that I use. And some of these tools, like deep breathing exercises are free, and engaging mindfulness ideas with lollies is cheap. Its good to be able to share these the tools with others. It won't "cure" another person,but I have tools that I can share with other people.      5  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Quercus  Community Champion                 3369 posts        17 April 2018

                                    in reply to smallwolf     I love the idea of your friend taking you outside to talk Wolfy. Isn't that a beautiful thing!  Your reason to stick around is equally as valid and lovely. I've seen a few of your posts around even while struggling with suicidal thoughts and you're right... I think your replies are a gift.  My reason is similar today (it's been a horrible one so the thoughts are eating at me).  When I feel low. Smashed down and pulled apart. And wanting it all to end so I can sleep and not have to wake up.... I can share those feelings.  And maybe someone reading will see themselves in my words too. And feel shocked to see I'm an utter mess but not ashamed of it or trying to pretend it is all ok.  Why should we have to pretend. Pretending just keeps the stigma around mental illness alive and kicking.  So I will get through today. And I'll get through tomorrow. And keep getting up and trying because this crap will pass eventually. And I'll keep trying and writing so that if one person reading sees themselves and decides to wait until morning and go see the doctor again then that is worth living for.      4  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           LizaMac     1 posts        17 April 2018

I always knew that there are more like me but I never had the guts to talk about it to anyone. I am in a constant state of self hurt. I agree it's not as bad as suicide,but I had my reasons.  - my parents . I don't want them to be sad because of me. I have already caused a lot of sadness for them  - I have a student loan to pay off. I don't want to leave without doing this. It will eventually fall on my parents.    I am smart enough to know what will kill me so I make sure I only keep the pain constant. It's like a punishment to myself. I don't want to do it anymore but I can't get out of the cycle. As you all suggested, I have reasons to stay on this side of life but I want to stop this.      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           romantic_thi3f  Community Champion                      2202 posts        18 April 2018

It means so much to me that you're reading it, posting it and most importantly, still here.  I wish that I had more words but I don't think there are any so I'm sending hugs over the internet if you want them.  Keep finding these reasons because you are worth it  :)  LizaMac - sometimes people just walk into the emergency department, but given that this is not always received well (sadly) it's best if you can chat to your GP or psychologist (if you are seeing one).  That way they personally can chat with you and arrange for a much smoother transition.

I relate to what you are dealing with. I am stuck in this cycle of self-loathing and self-harm. I want to get out but I can't. I wrote in another post on my thread:  "Ya know this is a bit random, but sometimes when I'm doing my German lessons I think 'this is so hard I want to give up I can't do it anymore'. I feel the same way about depression, but there's a catch- I don't get to say whether I want to do this anymore or not (bar suicide). I can't just opt out and say 'hey I've had enough of being depressed, just going to go back to my normal life'. I wish I could, that would solve all my problems, just giving up being depressed, but life doesnt work like that, and in a perfect world no one would have MH issues and we'd all be happy."  I agree, its not as bad as suicide, but its close. I am a suicide attempt survivor and it was a very traumatic experience, yet i still self-harm because it gives me a release.  Just letting you know that we are always here if you want to talk x. also remember that as well as those reasons for 'staying here' you have all the people in your life who love you to think about. You are important! You are a beautiful person. And you're worth it.  Chloe      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Amy23     17 posts        23 April 2018

Topic: Do you have a safety plan?   21 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        Sophie_M  Community Moderator            1396 posts        10 March 2016    Safety planning involves creating a structured plan – ideally with support from your health professional or someone you trust – that you work through when you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts, feelings, distress or crisis.  Your safety plan starts with things you can do by yourself, such as thinking about your reasons to live and distracting yourself with enjoyable activities. It then moves on to coping strategies and people you can contact for support – your friends, family and health professionals.  The safety planning model was developed in the US by suicide prevention experts Barbara Stanley and Gregory Brown. It has been used extensively by US veterans’ health organisations, hospital emergency departments and high schools, and there is strong evidence that it works. Many health professionals in Australia also use some form of safety planning to support clients experiencing suicidal thoughts or feelings, or after a suicide attempt.  beyondblue has an app you can use to create a safety plan, called BeyondNow.   The BeyondNow app takes the principles of safety planning and makes it even easier to use – so rather than carrying around a piece of paper, you’ve got it on your phone at all times. It’s free to download from the Apple Store or Google Play.  If you don’t have a smartphone or would prefer to use your desktop or laptop, BeyondNow is also available to use on our website.  Do you have a safety plan?  Do you have questions around how you might create one, or fill out some of the sections?  This thread is for discussing ideas around creating a safety plan, and sharing tips about what has been most useful about this process for you.  Below are two videos featuring Peter and Nic, who have both used safety plans successfully.

I think it is great and I am grateful that you guys at beyondblue start looking at some apps. I don't use this app at the moment as I feel comfortable with my current safety plan, which is on my phone as well, but it is typed and in various locations and having it all in one place is great idea.

There were significant cost and feature implications involved with making this app compatible for older phones, so we made the decision to go with iOS8 or later as this reaches over 90% of iphone users.  The web version of Beyond Now is optimised for mobile , so you should find the experience of creating a plan on our website very similar to what you would get with the app.       1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Becs125     13 posts        23 August 2016

                                    in reply to Becs125     Hi Becs125, it's great that you have a safety plan.  Your life matters and it's good to have a number of strategies to support it. Safety plans are like any other tool, they work best when they're used correctly.  Here's some tips: 1. It's best to access your safety plan when you are just starting to feel a bit bad, when you just  start noticing your thoughts are heading you in that direction. 2. Feelings of ambivalence (mixed feelings) are common.  Many people find their thoughts going to and fro between wanting to live and wanting to die. The side of you that wants to live probably needs some help as suicidal thoughts can be so seductive, and this is another good trigger to recognise and go to your safety plan when you feel like this. 3. Safety plans are best developed collaboratively so that the ideas are yours (you mention your plan was written up for you - how much input did you have into it?). The best time to write a safety plan is when you are feeling more aligned with that side of you that wants to live. Finally Becs125, as well as the threads here, you might want to also look at the Metanoia website - it's been put together by people who have been suicidal for people who are suicidal. I hope this helps.      6  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Nickname_65BD5CCF-CA54-46B9-B02C-9BDF53393F90     60 posts        7 September 2016

                                    in reply to Sophie_M     Sophie_M:  I have used the app (iPhone 4s) and thought it was extremely well designed.  I did it at the wrong time, which is beyond your power, and answering questions about who I have to talk to (no one) made me feel horrible, but that was self inflicted for trying to go do the plan when in a very depressive state.  I think you already have a warning about this :)  I've suggested it to a few people, and stressed the whole do it with someone you trust or when you you are on an up.  I particularly think it useful for psychologists working with people and think you should make an effort at aiming some info about it towards them particularly people working with youth.

I have only done one with my mental health nurse because I had to complete one to register for disability services. It was very general such as calling 000 if required and talking to my mum during uni hours if required. But I have never completed on by myself and being fully honest about it. I downloaded the BeyondNow app a while ago and looked at it and struggled to do it. I am going to complete it now but I was just wanting to add in that for me it was a bit daunting and I am pretty sure it is normal to feel this way  Stay safe :)        1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           LadyLazarus  blueVoices member            10 posts        8 November 2016

You probably are unable to complete a safety plan because the darkness is holding you down. Your brain is spiralling and making everything feel worse and harder than normal. The good news is that you can get through this and there is support for you. Hey, if I could crawl out of the hole - so can you.  Also, having lost my mum to suicide, I made a vow to never do that to anyone I loved, because its a pain not even your worst enemy deserves. xx      2  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Artistaffame     7 posts        14 January 2017

Its good because I can recognize when my thoughts are getting too overwhelming. And make plans to do something to distract myself.

My partner helps me. He locks away my medication and only gives me what i need when I need it. He's a good boy :).  I also promise myself every morning, no matter what happens, I will give myself 24 hours to work through issues. No sudden decisions.  I also ensure every day that I spend time patting/ massaging my little dog. She loves the massage and I calm down when with her  If thats a plan then it does seem to be working.  I might however check out your app anyway as I do love being proactive in my health.

Make your safety plan incredibly thorough and detailed. So that when you are in a space where you can't think about anything but self harm or suicide you don't have to think about what to do...  Just work through the steps. One dot point at a time.  My psychologist said the point was giving yourself time. Time for the feelings to pass. Time to realise that this impulse will pass and suicide will not make the pain go away.. . It will just give it to someone else (people who care about you).  For me this meant a HUGE plan on my fridge and written out on my phone. No thinking involved just follow my own plans and keep safe.   Distraction techniques listed out in dot points (all realistic things and a LOT of them). Most importantly options for ANY time of day or night.  Then names and numbers of people I could call. First friends and family. Then the helplines (all of them). Then the suicide call back service. All numbers listed. Read and dial and talk. One at a time.  Then a list of options of where I could go to have company and keep myself physically safe. Or people I know I could call and ask to come to me. What I needed to do to keep my environment safe (ie asking hubby to take meds and certain things out of the house).  Then emergency plan. What to do if all else fails. Where to go. Numbers to call. And to make sure the first aid kit is stocked and accessible at all times before this point.   Personally I don't use apps. Your safety plan can be as enormous as you need. In any format that works for you. The only goal is keeping yourself safe. How you achieve that is up to you.      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           LuLu.     206 posts        23 October 2017

When i am in a bad place I overthink it and say to myself “you have been worse” or “you can feel even worse then this you don’t need the safety plan yet” I suppose i am just unsure if i will ever be in real danger to myself. Sometimes I worry about myself but not enough to open the app and review my plan.  I am not sure if anyone else has felt like this before.

I have the Beyond Blue safety plan and used it several times over recent months.I find that when I am feeling very depressed I cannot work a computer but I can manage to use the phone app when I am confused and muddle headed.  I like Quercus's idea of making your plan very detailed.  I find the phone app very reassuring that I have it. I don't have any friends or family listed to call but I do have the lifeline number. It feels like a little friend in my pocket that keeps me company and goes wherever I go.  I also have made a "Care Box" (My Psychiatrist suggested that)= shoe box with photos of my children when they were young and a few photos of the sea and other things I like.  I also have a "Care Box" on Pinterest, so I can look at lots of beautiful photos of nature and animals etc .      2  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful            Close

Getting help... where to start when not nearby?  Unfortunately the situation your brother is in right at the moment is not unknown, and in fact happens too often. It is most often excused as being a combination of work overload in the Emergency Department and a lack of on-shift specialist staff to take the matter further.  Some clients have simply walked out after such a start.  I think it is terribly bad for your brother, who has had already to face the idea of getting help -and agreeing, and then to find he is virtually ignored. To be sent home under such circumstances too in not unknown, and again can be very inappropriate.  What to do? I'm not sure as I do not know the structure of the hospital, however I guess you find whoever is in charge of the ED, get the name of the person in charge of Mental Health Services and strongly put forward the case, as his next of kin,  that  the long wait, uncertainty and prospect of being sent home are all completely unacceptable, as is no spelled out plan of what is intended.  It may take perseverance to accomplish this and I'd strongly suggest you do nothing that could be misinterpreted and get yourself ejected from the hospital.  If all else fails stating you wish to make a formal complaint and starting to take names and details in writing may be a very last resort.  Courtesy but firmness are your only real resources, together with the fact that most of the nurses and other ED staff actually do care  In between all this company for your brother would probably be a good idea.

I am so very sorry that you have had such a disappointing experience and that you have had to wait and had the most unsatisfactory support there.  As Croix said, you can take this up with them and I really think you should.  I just also wanted to say that even though you are at ED and you are WAITING..please do not feel like you still are not able to call on the services of Lifeline while you are there, if you are so very scared and desperate as you wait, even having someone on the phone to support you through this time while you wait could be helpful to you both when you are not getting immediate help from the ED.  All the best to you and to your brother and to you too, you should feel so very proud of yourself.  I would love to know how you are getting along.

I have a good job, a loving family but my husband has been out of work.  He now has a new job and i am terrified he is going to lose it because its sales and his boss is putting pressure on him and he is an older worker. Everyone is disposable these days and i am just waiting for him to call me and tell me has been sacked.  Because he hasn't made a sale yet it seems like a real possibility.  He has been made redundant twice and was working as relief teacher which was high stress too and he doesn't want to do that anymore.  We could survive barely on my wage because of my mortgage. I know there are things we could do like downsize our house but the market is terrible and we could end up losing money over that.  I feel so overwhelmed by it all that sometimes i wish it could all end. I have spent 2 days effectively in bed. I shouldn't be like this. I am the one in my family who fixes everything but i have had a hard workload at work and now this stress is taking it's toll on me. I just want it all to go away. I know my problems are nothing compared to my friend who's husband is dying.  I have a good life really. I don't know what's wrong with me at the moment.  I don't want my 11 year old son see me like this and feel like i am failing everyone.         Mark this post as helpful           sparrowhawk     154 posts        11 October 2019

                                    in reply to Bookgirl     Hi and welcome. I am so sorry you are going through such a thing. Anxiety is a terrible feeling.  Unfair things can unfortunately happen in the workplace. When did your husband start his job? I would think it is fair and right to offer employees a sort of probationary period, or at least to ease them in at the beginning.  It does sound like your anxiety is overtaking you and forcing you to think about and dwell on the worst-case scenarios. Anxiety makes us irrational and makes us jump to often exaggerated conclusions. I am not saying your fears are not valid, but anxiety tells you they are certainties rather than possibilities. I am going through anxiety at the moment and something I find helpful is simply to take things one day at a time, and to be aware of my triggers. The things that make me most anxious on particular days may never happen. Knowing what makes me anxious doesn't take away my anxiety, but it does help me to be a little more prepared.  It is okay to take time for yourself. "Should" and "shouldn't" can be very destructive words. You are stressed and anxious, and you rightly need to take time for yourself to relax and recharge. There is no weakness in that. Also, comparing your struggles to those of another never helps. Your friend's issues are painful, but her pain and your pain are different and can't be compared. Not because yours is lesser, but because it is simply different. I work in a hospital and I hear the statement that "someone has it worse than me" almost every day. While it is certainly good to try not to feel sorry for ourselves, what is difficult for me might be easy for you. We can't compare struggles and their effects on others precisely because we are not the other person, we do not know their life as they know it.  I really encourage you to continue listening to yourself and your needs, but also to set small goals for yourself. Maybe you could consider having a good shower, or relaxing with a cup of tea, or listening to some music you like, or doing something you enjoy but perhaps don't often get the time to do. Little things that aren't overwhelming but will help you to feel more together.      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Bookgirl     78 posts        11 October 2019

                                    in reply to sparrowhawk     i just feel so overwhelmed and don't know what to do.  I didn't go to work again today because i just couldnt' face it. Didn't tell my husband that because it would make him more stressed.  Thinking today i realise its all about the financial stuff.  When i was young we lost our house and my dad was on the dole.  I dont remember that as a bad time. Part of me thinks if we didn't have the financial burden of a mortgage we would be happier. My husband doesn't think that way though.  I would love to just not have this hanging over my head.  I am a bit over reacting as we have money in the bank if he loses his job.  It's just he was looking for a while. It's not easy to get another job and i did a lot of the work in applying (which i know is wrong) and i am just exhausted from it all.  I am exhausted from taking on the burden all the time which i have always done in my life.  I panic at the thought of starting from scratch again.  I lay in bed and think about just going to sleep and not waking up as that would be easier.  But then i have an 11 year old son who needs me.  I booked an appointment to see the work psych as one i was seeing a year ago is away. Maybe that will help.  I am just so tired of it all and don't know how to move forward.  I am just waiting all the time for my husband to ring me and tell me he has been fired.         Mark this post as helpful           Tam28     6 posts        11 October 2019

                                    in reply to Bookgirl     Hi bookgirl  Sorry this is my first attempt at trying to help someone, hopefully I don't make things worse.  You said that your wage can cover the mortgage, it may not be comfortable but you could make it work, you might have to live on tinned beans for a little while or downgrade the car, but you can survive if your husband was to loose his job, it will only be short term. I know it's hard but you need to realise that you having your job is important, because if you both don't have a job then you could get yourself into trouble. Try focusing on yourself and doing your job and the rest will fall into place in time. Don't give up 😊         Mark this post as helpful           Bookgirl     78 posts        11 October 2019

                                    in reply to Tam28     Thanks, i have a govt job so i am pretty secure.  I think i just need to calm down so i can think this through clearer but have managed to get myself in a state over the last few weeks and this was the last straw (as my dr told me on monday).  You definitely didn't make things worse. Thanks for being there and listening. I am feeling very alone at the moment and it does help that someone cared enough to reply.

                                    in reply to Bookgirl     You are very lucky that you have a secure job, a family you love, able to afford a mortgage, a husband who can get a job (Even if this isn't the right one he's still capable) you have so much positive in your life. You need to realise you already do enough for your family by providing security and love. Try to keep focused on those parts. Keep getting help. Hopefully you can find something that works for you         Mark this post as helpful           monkey_magic     2510 posts        12 October 2019

                                    in reply to Bookgirl     Hi Bookgirl,  You've already had some terrific responses.  You sound very worn out to me. Perhaps you need to let go of the reigns for a while.  Sure, sales jobs are very competitive and he could be sacked. I've been sacked before. But, there are plenty of other jobs out there. You're husband sounds like he wants to work which is positive so I'm sure something else will come up if things don't work out at this job. Sales is so hard anyway. As long as he keeps applying something should eventually pop up.  Youre not in dyre straights just yet- I'm sure it will all work out.  P.S..I know how you feel about not wanting the mortgage hanging over your head. I've never had one. I'm currently at home with mum and have been renting something cheap in the past like a room, granny flat or house extension. That's what suits me as I fell on hard financial times in the past. A mortgage scares me- I only work casually which is why.  Give yourself a huge pat on the back you're doing much better in life than you realize.

                                    in reply to Doz86     Thanks but i am really struggling at the moment.  I don't know that we could pay for the mortgage long term on just my wage.  The house market here is rubbish and we could end up in debt. I have had to keep so strong for a long time and it's always me who fixes up the problems and i don't feel strong enough at the moment to cope with this again.  I am crying a lot and am just waiting for my husband to call me and tell me he is out of work.  He tells me not to worry but i can't help it. He is on 3 months probation and hasn't made a sale. There are 2 others in sales who haven't either but that doesn't make me feel any better.  I know he is trying but i am so angry at the world at the moment.  I feel guilty because he told me he didn't want to do sales anymore and i feel like i made him do it. As he is 56 it is harder for him to find work. I just feel completely overwhelmed by it all and i don't really know what to do. The pysch told me to do meditation etc but it isn't really helping. I need to be stronger than this but i just don't have the energy.         Mark this post as helpful           Bookgirl     78 posts        17 October 2019

Just don't have the energy to do anything really.  Have to stay strong for everyone and start the process of looking for jobs for him again.  Makes me want to cry all the time.

                                    in reply to Sophie_M     Thanks for the concern. I have been feeling really stressed about it all.  I reached out to some people and have had some support. My chiropractor gave me a hug and some natural stress relief tablets which was lovely.  My son keeps making me laugh because he doesn't want me to be sad.  My husband is more positive than me which i think is a bit naive because in this day and age they don't care if you are nice and a hard worker. It's all about results.  Sales is incredibly hard and he didn't want to get back into it but we needed the money.  He actually loves where he is working and helping people but nobody will buy anything which is incredibly frustrating.  I went to a funeral today of a 84 year old.  Her mother was left with 2 young kids when her husband died but she soldiered on.  I need to be more resilient but have been run down by a lot of things happening at once and totally overwhelmed.  It's hard to drag yourself up from the bottom when everything seems so bleak. Thanks for caring.  I feel so alone sometimes.  Just words of encouragement help.  I don't think things are going to get better any time soon so i have to prepare for that. I am no good at being positive (which i am sure everyone can tell). Comes from my mum who was mentally ill and who i looked after. I just get so tired of having to fix everything up (even though no one really asks me too).  Other people have life so much harder but just someone recognising I was in pain yesterday and giving me a hug was so wonderful.  Thanks for the support again and caring.

My husband doesn't like to see me cry because he says it takes his focus away from his job which i totally get but i am finding it hard to keep it together.  His boss says horrible things to him and i just know she is going to fire him.  I don't want him to work there because of how she is but at the same time it was so hard for him to get a job in the first place.  Am so tired of thinking about it all.

                                    in reply to Bookgirl     Dear Bookgirl~  I can understand all your worries, and the fact you are taking responsibility of your family, and have done so for a long time.  No matter how hard you try you cannot control all circumstances, eihter for better or worse. with an anxiety conditon it might help you plan, but it makes you look on the worst side, and takes a very heavy toll on you in the process.  This is not helped by your family having money troubles when you are young, or a husband that says your crying affects his focus on his job. Really speaking his job is making you feel better moment by moment, just as your son is doing.  Your son has the right idea, when you can't control try to distract yourself with the good things you like. True it does not affect the overall situation, but gives you respite and builds your sense of perspective.  My perspective is terrible, I normally think the worst, an anxiety condition symptom. So I read, watch moves, play wiht the nicer of the two cats, talk of restful thngs with my partner. Actually she is the one that persuades me when my worries are realy not that realistic.  I'm glad you have booked in with a psychologist, it is a good idea, maybe a GP too, I found not only the therapy and talk, but also the meds were a help.  Following your posts over the years I think you will make things survivable, with good times in there too, even if things do not pan out quite as you would like them now.  You called yourself Bookgirl, may I ask what you like to read? (I've more than my local  library I think).

                                    in reply to Croix     You're right. Your post made me smile.  You asked me what i like to read.  Fittingly enough it's fantasy fiction. I have always had a good imagination which has its good and bad points.  Good in that I like to write which helps me destress.  Bad in that no one catastrophizes quite like me.  My problem is that i want to fix this to make it go away and i can't.  What will be will be and i can't control that and it drives me absolutely insane.  From my other posts you will know that i want to control always that which is uncontrollable.  I read a lot of self help books and one that i like says that when you don't accept reality it hurts and that is exactly what is happening now. I want to just try and live mindfully and i thought i was getting better at it but when this situation arose it's like all my bad habits just flooded back and absolutely destroyed me again.

                                    in reply to Bookgirl     Dear Bookgirl  Fantasy fiction is one of my favorite ways of giving the mind a rest, Eddings, Modessitt, Anthony, Bujold ... the list goes on. To deliberately set aside each day a time to distract oneself is a very positive method of coping.  As for everything coming back, it is a bit like building a dam, as you build more the number of times all the old horrible thoughts and sensations return becomes less. Your dam is simply not high enough yet, remember times when it has worked, you do have them written down after all.  I'm not going to have a catastrophization comparison with you:) You are experienced and aware enough that it is a symptom. One of the best things my partner does for me is point out when I'm over the top with worry that it is not reasonable given the circumstances. It really helps.  I've found Brene Brown  talks a lot of sense in the self-help area, if you are not familiar with  her she has a fair number of TED and YouTube talks.

                                    in reply to Croix     My husband has been moved sideways now which i was really happy about. His supervisor was very supportive and even the owner said that she had been hard on him.  Now he has to do telesales which means 100 calls a day and 4 sales.  He has done this kind of work before but i am still panicking because he has lost confidence after the last 2 months.  They seem really willing to give him a chance and help him along but because of my anxiety at the moment and exhaustion, i am a mess again that he won't meet his target. I know its my thinking and not reality and that the odds are just as great that he will succeed and not fail but i am still a jumble of nerves because i am so worn out.  When you are in this state of mind it is so so hard to get out of.  But i will do as you suggest and try and distract myself.  Thank you so so much for being patient and listening to my rants.

                                    in reply to Bookgirl     Dear Bookgirl~  I think your husband has found a place that sounds reasonable - not unfeeling. Telesales is taxing, however is your husband pleased about the move? Does it give him some confidence now? Hopefully he will at least feel there are people behind him at work.  Do you think he will look for different work even so? After all some jobs have less pressure.  Yes after all the mental stress you have been though it will be hard to ramp down to a more manageable level.  I've no magic formula but suspect exercise (do you swim?) reading and humor all can help. I find these of great help, and although I can't really walk very far just getting out the gate is good.  If you have a look though  Forums / Anxiety / SELF HELP TIPS FOR MANAGING ANXIETY  Which is very long, I've found a lot in it to help me.  As for listening, I too give vent to my feelings at times, we can need it.  Croix           Mark this post as helpful           Bookgirl     78 posts        23 October 2019

                                    in reply to Croix     I am still extremely nervous about the situation until he makes a sale. I lay awake last night thinking about it. My husband then gets up this morning and tells me he has been worrying about my 11 year old son's maths test so maybe i am over thinking it.  He has done telesales before.  I think a repetitive process type job suits him but he has to prove himself which makes me anxious just thinking about it.  I keep telling myself that i have to just let go and let things be.  I can't do the job for him. I can't make him any better than he is.  He will try his best and that is all i can ask of him.  He held down jobs in sales before this.  It's just over the last few years he got made redundant twice and now i am just doubting his capabilities.  I just have to learn to let go of all my control freak tendencies which is really really hard but its making me miserable.

                                    in reply to Bookgirl     Dear Bookgirl~  This may sond to start with like a non sequitur, please bear with me.  A year or two ago  I developed a spot on a lung.  For some technical reason or other a biopsy could not be done and I had to wait 3 months for another MRI to see if the spot had grown.  Naturally I thought the big C - I'd been a very heavy smoker most of my life, start very young.  The logical finish to that thoght was that I was not long for this earth.  It had a surprising effect, as you might imagine I thoght in detail about waht I ought to do, arrangements to make, see if there was any way those I'd been looking after could survive without out my efforts and so on.  I ended up to my surprise whittling down the number of obligations, duties and responsibilities I'd taken so seriously all my life to very few - and this did not include steering and supporting those I loved to excess. While I would not call it vanity I would say it was taking away from them, even though it appeared needful and done out of care.  Why say all this? You have the whole weight of your family on your shoulders - as did I -  and it is too much - for anyone.  You will all get there together. As I suggested before get a joke (the internet is a good source) and go make your offspring groan with it. A change of pace, a balm.

I have a history of being anxious about my health (and everything else).  With me it's all about being in control.  I know its just a product of my family history but giving up bad habits is the hardest thing.  I am really trying and thanks for your encouragement.  I've had anxiety since i was 6 years old and I have to manage it every day.  I am much better at looking after everyone else but myself.  My son did tell me a joke the other day.

                                    in reply to Croix     Despite all my best intentions having a full blown panic attack today. My husband had to go to this meeting with the owner at a customer's. He was already nervous because she is a micro manager and criticises everything.  He started typing a text to me and then sent it early after i knew he had had the meeting so i only got a few words. I have been panicking ever since because he hasn't responded to me. I know no news is good news.  He would ring me if he had been fired but i started practically hyperventilating.  Went for a walk and managed to calm down but feel sick to the stomach waiting for him to talk to me again. I know i can't control anything that will happen but my emotions just take over and i just fall apart.  I hate being this way. When i get like this i just want to curl up in bed, pull the sheets over my head and hide.  I know that doesn't solve anything but again when you aren't coping it just feels easier.

                                    in reply to Bookgirl     Dear Bookgirl  I'm afraid best intention have noting to do with it, you anxiety has simply grown and that is the reaction.As far as medical treatment is concerned you have mentioned booking an appointment with a psychologist at work, and that's all I can see.  I apologise if I've missed something.  Your anxiety seem to have reached the stage it is very much taking over your life, though managing to keep on working, going to meetings and so forth is a credit to you it is time to take the matter seriously.  I did not and ended up a right mess. So please don't repeat my mistake. Go see your GP in a long consultation, telling in detail about what  is happening to you, the pacing mind, the panic attacks, all of it.  Hopeful this may lead to long term professional help, a Mental Health Plan with a psychologist, or a safety net with a psychiatrist (my own choice). I kept on getting worse until I had competent medical help. I'd made matters worse by leaving things until too late.  I know you may not like it but I found Smiling Mind was the only way to relieve great tension when I was waiting for something important.  I hope your husband returns reporting all in order.

                                    in reply to Croix     Thanks for your concern. Everything was fine with my husband.  I am on antidepressants (have been for years).  I saw my dr recently (who knows my mental health history) and he told me to go to see a psych and gave me paperwork to get a mental health plan.  Unfortunately the psych i was seeing previously was on holidays til the end of October. It's always the way when you want to see someone they aren't available :(.  So i went to see a psych through work. Unfortunately i have only been able to get one appointment because they are so busy so that wasn't much good. But i have now booked in for a few in advance so i can get some help.  I have reached out to a few people who have been supportive. I have told my husband how i am feeling and he is supportive. I've just literally burned myself out i think.  I have a history of this.  Two years in a row about this time of year i have been sick - pneumonia and shingles.  Otherwise about this time of year i am a mental wreck.   We have tended to go on holidays the last few years in Sept and every time i get a panic attack when i am supposed to be relaxing.  It's a vicious circle that i need to work on.  As you know mental health is a management thing.  I had a breakdown when i was 18, managed to pull myself out of that but have been working on it ever since.  I have ups and downs like everyone. Yesterday was a big down and thank you for being there.  This is the only place where i really vent my irrational feelings because people don't judge me for it.  They know it's just someone who needs help.  It gives me comfort when someone responds because it feels like i am not alone.  I am at the bottom at the moment but i am slowly clambering back up out of my black hole.  Thanks again.

                                    in reply to Bookgirl     Dear Bookgirl~  I'm very relieved that you do have medical support, hopefully you will find the MHP a help. Please remember you are in charge, and should any aspect, particularly the effect of your therapy sessions not work well talk about it wiht your doctor or psych and see if any changes can be made. It's a hard thing for people to realise however with only 6 or 10 sessions p.a. each has to do some good  The whole point of this place is others do understand, having been there, or going though it now. It never sounds silly, just to be expected. Not coping with waiting is a weakness of mine too.  I'm very glad matters worked out with your husband and he is supportive.  As for time of year, is there anything you can change? I have had a fair number of respiratory problems but found putting  heat pump/air conditioner in the bedroom made a huge difference to my health.

                                    in reply to Croix     My husband's job is still not safe. I get anxiety every night before he comes home.  But i have been trying to be pro active. I have been looking and applied for other jobs. I have noted the sectors that need workers like aged care where you can get cheaper training. These RTO's can help you find work and they all need workers.  Doesn't stop me being anxious. He said tonight the boss wanted to see him and I had started eating dinner. Now i haven't been able to eat anything. Not eating is a big thing with my anxiety. I know intellectually we can get through this together but as you know sometimes your brain just takes over and i just jump to worst case scenarios. This afternoon my son has been coming up and giving me hugs and kisses spontaneously because he says i look sad. He is the most beautiful soul.  When you get really anxious it is so hard to climb back out of that hole. I keep slipping back down but i am going to keep trying.  My husband is a hard worker.  Everyone at his work has noticed this and complimented him on it. Won't save him but i know he is doing his best.  I am going to take some medication to calm me down tonight so i get a good night's sleep.  Medication doesn't help everyone but it does help me. I think i am such an intense personality that i stress myself out all year and then i just fall apart when my body starts screaming it can't cope with the stress anymore. I don't think its the time of year per se or the environment it's just my body and brain reaches its breaking point.  Thanks again for listening and caring.

                                    in reply to Bookgirl     Dear Bookgirl~  If meds work that a big win, I took many years to fine one that suits.  I guess one thing you ought to remember is that your son has you in him, the observation, care and spontaneity are inside you too, just masked by the stress and anxiety. They are waiting to reemerge.  If I remember you have a secure job wiht the government, that is a blessing to have such a backstop.  Having a partner that works hard is also something to lean on, if this job disappears it will be the job and its purpose and setup, not him. His talents remain.  Frankly if I was conducting job interviews for a reputable firm I'd not see someone who got out of telesales as being in any way deficient.  You never know, your husband might take well to aged care, you did mention he likes helping people.

Topic: Am I depressed here or just being a softie?   6 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        dashi     3 posts        26 November 2019    Apologies in advance for my bad grammar here.  First of all, I do have histories of hurting myself when I was younger and ever since then, there's always a constant voice in my head that I have to keep at bay but, lately it's been getting louder. I knew since then that this will be a constant battle till the day I die.  Honestly, my life is in a bit of a pit at the moment and I realized that it put my mind in the wrong spot. I have very bad pressure from work. I might be losing my position soon, which has been stressing me out badly. I feel like I couldn't hold on to a single job or getting decent at it. I can't focus on my task, I always have anxiety attacks which, make me less productive at work. My colleagues always snarky comments about my productivity at work, they always pretend it was just a joke but, hey, there is always a little bit of truth in every joke. I told them that it bothers me, it stops for a while and now it starts again. HR doesn't really help, since my colleagues are close to them. It's a real pain going to work every day. I got no one to talk to, no friends and not even close with my own family. No romantic relationship to speak off and I'm just living day by day hoping the next one will be better than the one before. And It's not, - here I am typing this late at night, I can already imagine the shitty day I will have tomorrow.  I tried to rekindle friendships but, I always find myself to be the one reaching out. Asking for a catch-up session with anyone available. Starting to feel like a damn burden to them. If I don't try to contact them, no one would bother to contact me. When they do agree to catch up, I always try to focus on them. Knowing that if I try to vent, it will bore them nor, will they asked me how I'm doing.  If there is a button to erase my existence completely, I would have broken the sound barrier by how fast I would have moved to pressed it. What stopped me from ending it all those years ago, is that I don't want to be a burden for my family and then friends. Kept thinking, Maybe if I save enough money before I peace out, that would at least make things easier, but that's a bit selfish, isn't it? I do have enough cash now but, every day I'm still hoping I will find something good. Anything really..  To be clear, I'm not looking for a pity party and I realized that everything I write is pretty vague. I just want to know if this is depression? Is this it guys? or am I just being softie?  Sorry for venting.          Mark this post as helpful           Sophie_M  Community Moderator            1396 posts        27 November 2019

                                    in reply to dashi     Hi dashi  I firstly want to start by apologizing for the delay in responding to you, sometimes posts get missed and this is no reflection on your post, they sometimes just slip through.  I am so glad you have found yourself here and posting on the Beyond Blue forum and that you did try to reach out to us when you were feeling so down and perhaps depressed.  You have so very much on your plate and with the uncertainty of your job and feeling like you have no support from your friends when you reach out is so hard to manage and it is really hard to take, especially when you feel the communication instigation is all just one way.  Can I ask if you have made an appointment to see your GP? How would you feel about doing that?  They have some wonderful tools and support and can really help during this time, especially if you feel that perhaps you are experiencing depression.  Please do not apologize for venting here, that is what we are here for, to support you and to help you through this time.  It is most certainly not a pity party, you are doing all you can and have so very much on your plate, your feelings are valid and you need to take care of them.  I am so sorry that you have had so much pain in the past that you have hurt yourself, this is really tough and I am hearing you in that you feel like the only thing left to do is to end it.  This is most certainly not the answer and your family do love you so very much and you are needed here and wanted here.  Can I also say that no amount of money that you leave will be satisfactory to replace your life.  I lost my brother just 3 months ago to suicide, he was 19, if he had of left 1 Billion dollars it would just be paper on the floor, there is no price on a family members value and love.  I am so happy to hear that you are trying to find something good and this really does not have to be how your life will stay forever, reach out to your GP, give one of the numbers a call that Sophie has left, please..you matter.  I am so sorry that it has taken so long for us to reach you and I hope you can come back and chat.  Huge hugs to you dashi.

Topic: How to help Ex-Partner?   2 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        MayDaisy     1 posts        4 December 2019    Hi everyone,  I recently broke up with my partner of almost 4 years. It was my decision, and came about for a multitude of reasons. He is a lovely man though.  He rang me last night, to get what seemed like closure. He then started suggesting he was planning to die, as he has no one/nothing anymore (he does have a young daughter from a previous relationship, but their relationship has been rocky lately). He had some pretty big career upheavals over the last few years, and I almost feel from our conversation that my leaving has been the straw that broke the camel's back.  He advised me he has spoken to a GP and had counselling which hasn't helped, along with contacting a lifeline-type service.  I'm at a loss how to support him - our relationship is over, I still care immensely about him, but from what was said last night, it seems the only thing that would make a difference now would be to go back.  I know he will struggle to talk to anyone, but have strongly suggested he speaks to his best friend and/or sister, but all I get is a strong no to those suggestions.    Any suggestions would be appreciated.         Mark this post as helpful           Quercus  Community Champion                 3369 posts        6 December 2019

                                    in reply to MayDaisy     Hi MayDaisy,  Saying your situation is difficult feels like a massive understatement. But it is a horrible position to be in and I do feel for you.  It is incredibly unfair (and perhaps even manipulative) of your ex to refuse to speak to his friends or sister. It puts far too much pressure on you and stops you from getting the distance you might need after ending the relationship.  How do you think he would react if you asked his sister and a trusted friend for help? Although you care for him, it isn't your responsibility to manage his health.  Plus the level of support it sounds like he needs if he is suicidal isn't necessarily something an ex partner can give! If he wants to rely on you to always help how can either of you move on?  In my 20s I had a boyfriend who threatened suicide if I left him. I chose to walk away and put distance between us. It was awful. I just cried and shut down for a long time but stuck with my choice. His friends rang and said it would be my fault if he hurt himself. Called me heartless and selfish and cruel.  In that situation my parents decided to override his wishes. He wanted my help, wouldn't accept help from anyone else. But I couldn't/wouldn't give it. So they phoned his family and friends and told them he was at risk.  Regardless of what happens please try to remember he is responsible for himself. There is nothing preventing him from returning to the GP, asking for a referral to a psychiatrist, phoning mensline or the suicide callback service (I've used this and it was very helpful).  Have you got support from family/friends/medical professionals for yourself? It could be helpful for you to speak to someone to ask for help or even just to be reminded it is absolutely ok that you don't want to be part of the relationship anymore. You shouldn't have to feel obligated to stay because he is hurting.  I'd like to hear how you're holding up if you wish to update.  Nat           Mark this post as helpful            Close

I have tried some other things such as exercise ,massage that type of thing. all those things do help but are usually tough to do as you have no motivation for any thing. could not even imagine attempting something like meditation as I can't get my mind to focus or re loss at all.  I can't believe I'm at the stage of hospitalization or ECT ,is there other pathways to better mental health  I feel like I can't tell anyone how bad I actually am for fear of the stigma associated with hospitalization and ECT, or just mental health in general.  at least I can tell the forum      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Katyonthehamsterwheel     94 posts        1 December 2019

I'm no expert, just a fellow forum user, so I'm not sure about alternatives but I did find this page on the website here which might be helpful: https://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support/treatment-options  Perhaps you could also discuss your concerns around hospitalisation/ECT with your specialist further, and ask if there are any alternatives you could try? Motivation is definitely hard to come by when we feel low. Is there times when you feel good or even ok throughout the day where you might be able to do something that helps a little?

I have trouble with that one myself. I use a range of strategies that I find helpful. I have a psychologist that I see regularly (she's a godsend!) and I have meds, but I also exercise, check in with my breathing (pausing to take deep belly breaths a few times a day), I read lots of positive quotes and self help books, meditation, saying no to things that stress me out (like family), trying to focus on positives and things I've achieved (no matter how small), and I have a safety plan for when I'm having really bad thoughts that I can't get under control. Do you have a safety plan? Definitely something I'd recommend :)  Glad to hear you're going to get a second opinion if you're not feeling comfortable with what has been suggested.

There was a time when being employed I could afford the sessions @ $250 / hour, now that I am retired that is out of the question. Oh, I am told we give you 5 free sessions by the Govt, that is if you can find a Psych that bulk bills in one's area. One I was recommended to by Beyond Blue in my area wouldn't give a look in until they had access to my financial records to prove I wasn't rorting the system, I told them to jump! my daily moods go up and down and frustration is my main enemy at this time. I have had about enough of struggling and having to tread on eggshells around my family  who have no empathy to my situation of how I will cope for here or what I have been through in the past. Recently I went to the Grow group to see if it was for me I came away shattered,  I  didn't sleep and had an anxiety attack that lasted two days, so never again. It wasn't the group who I must say were very welcoming but the pressure I was feeling by being there I went into overload. where to now who know's.

                                    in reply to iamanxiety     The Grow group has it's origins in the AA support group only it deals with mental and social issues. The two days following I was physically sick but I managed to overcome it by online meditation and relaxation. It and depression are always there but the degree varies, I do suffer badly from performance anxiety so having to put myself out there in front of strangers did set it off by having to tell my history and join in the group. Medication is part of my daily routine and has been for most of my life, my mental problems are not biological but physical as I as a baby was given teething powder full of Mercury and it fried most of the receptors in my brain as well as a host of other side effects so it's not a illness that can be cured but has to be maintained. This illness date back to the middle ages where hat makers used Mercury to block hats and they eventually went mad. (hence the old saying Mad as a Hatter)Thanks for the reply I really appreciate it.         Mark this post as helpful           iamanxiety     13 posts        6 December 2019

I'm going to see my psychologist today and I'm anxious over that.  maybe try it in baby steps ,the group may have been to much for you at the moment.  I'm looking for a group to join and talk about my issues with like minded people but my mind holds me back.  sorry to hear about the origin of your illness.  we all have different causes but suffer the same . you may just need to approach yours from a different angle as we all probably do.  all the best         Mark this post as helpful            Close

But, I don't tend to tell people this. There was this guy, a few years older than me (he's a year 12) and he's been helping me out, he's a good friend of mine, but sometimes he gets angry when I do what he says is "stupid things" to myself. At least, I know he cares.  We go to drama together, and I only get to see him for two hours each week, which is hard, but that's not the point.  I made a big mistake:  I opened up a group chat, with about 10 people (my friends from drama) and I wrote a goodbye note. I don't think I should have done that. I also have anxiety, so I'm kinda scared that I made a mistake. I just wanted to say goodbye, in case I did something. I'm not planning anything just yet, but it was a "Just in case" note. I didn't tell them that though.    Only one person has replied. What should I do?

                                    in reply to ~Nik~     Hi Nik  I am so glad that you have reached out and come to get some support, I can see how scared and worried you are and you are in a place now to get some support and comfort here.  I would like to say though if you are not safe right now to please call an ambulance on 000, if you are ok but not feeling right at this moment can I ask you to call Lifeline on 13 11 14, there you will get to speak to some wonderful people who are professionals and can help you through this time.  I can hear how desperate you are in that you did write a good bye note to your friends, I also hear that you are really regretting doing that.  I am not sure what your friends would be thinking but I am sure that they are probably not sure what to do and how to react, depending on what you have said in your note they may have also seen it as an appreciation note and that you might be expressing your gratitude for their friendship.  Can I also ask if you have spoken to your parents about how you are feeling? I know you will not want to worry them however, they love you and will want to support you and comfort you through this time.  If you are not sure what to say you could show them your post here as it expresses very well how you are feeling and addresses the note that you sent to your friends.  I think also your parents would want to hear how you are feeling from you, and might I suggest that if one of your school friends have spoken to their parents they might be concerned and make contact with your parents.  Please reach out to them.  I lost my 19 year old brother to suicide only 3 months ago and I can tell you right now I would have given anything to be there with him at the point you are at now and to say how proud I was of him for speaking out, that mental illness and thoughts of suicide and worries in life can be helped with some assistance and that this is a rough time in  your life and not the rest of your life.  I would have held him and listened all night to him if it meant saving him.  Please give your parents the chance to help you, please let them love you and support you.  I am so proud that you have reached out here and that you have spoken, you are so very brave and so very  much loved and needed in this world Nik, hugs to you right now.  Please come back and chat as I care and would like to know how you are getting along.

                                    in reply to ~Nik~     Hi Nik, welcome  I'm sorry to hear your situation and feelings, you sound quite fragile.  Like AS I also lost my brother, he was 26yo and in 1978 a long time ago. (So sorry AS) Myself ans my sister have also attempted.  So what is the biggest message I'd like to say to you? Firstly get help as AS said, ring 000. Also be aware that as you grow up these tendencies tend to drift away then you'll be Soooo glad you remained strong as life will be so exciting.  Friends and family that are not trained in mental health will not have empathy towards your situation I'm afraid. Google  Beyondblue topic they just wont understand - why?  So that is why this forum is so good, a place you can go where birds of a feather talk together :)  Your action of saying goodbye will be seen as attention seeking. I know you didnt want that but it does highlight how sad and confused you are in life. Believe me, it is all temporary. This fellow seems to care- hang onto him as a friend because they are the type of people you need in your life.  Finally, as you talk to your friends if the topic arises about your goodbye message, just say "yeh, sorry about that, it wasnt the right thing to do, I wasnt feeling well". Now if they dont forgive you then it is their problem but most will.  I hope you stay in the forum as you please. You can add to your story if there is any developments and we can guide you through any issues.  PS well done in writing in, that takes courage even though its confidential.

                                    in reply to Aaronsis     Thank you for your advice.  Firstly, I know that they did not see it as a gratitude for their friendship, as I got a call from the police (that I missed) which surely would have been them saying something. I tried to call the police back, but they have no idea what I am talking about and I think they thought I was wasting their time.  My parents do know what I am going through but I don't tend to tell them stuff, as I know it upsets them and that hurts me. I don't tell them stuff because I don't want them to stop me.  I must seem hopeless, sorry.  - Nik         Mark this post as helpful           ~Nik~     10 posts        18 November 2019

For what it's worth, I'm glad that you're still here and haven't planned anything yet.  I know that if it had have been me on the other end of that group chat, I might not have replied either.  Not because it seems like you are attention seeking, but because it would shock me to the core to know that someone I was friends with was thinking of ending their life.  I don't really know that there's anything that seems quite right to say; I know I certainly wouldn't want to say goodbye!  I know that you regret sending that message, but I wonder if maybe now that you've done it you can use this to your advantage?  You've worried your friends enough to call the police, but maybe was that needed?  To show you that they care about you?  I'm interested to know too how things go when you next catch up with them.

                                    in reply to ~Nik~     Hi Nik  Can I start by saying you are most definitely not hopeless and I am so very happy that you have come back to chat, I hear what you are saying that you don't want to tell your parents too much as you don't want them to stop you, and you also said that you don't want to hurt them and the thought of them in pain actually hurts you.  I feel somewhat hopeful that these feelings of hurting your parents will help you to stay, can I say that hurt is not even close to what they will be feeling should you chose to take your life.  I am by no means trying to guilt you here but just want to say that my father is a broken man now, he will never be the same again.  We actually just got matching tattoos to honor my brother, my dad is 70, it was his first.  The pain and crying and emotion that came out of that man when he received that call was heart wrenching and sickening, I wish that on no human ever.  You are so loved and wanted in this world Nik, your parents love you and the fact your friend called the police suggests how much they care too, this is a rough time now Nik, this does not have to be a life sentence for you, there are so many people who would sit with you and help and hug you and get you through this time.  Please come back and chat and please reach out to someone or LifeLine 13 11 14 if you are really in a tough spot Nik, you are worth it, every bit of it.

                                    in reply to Aaronsis     Hi, I'm back again.  Some interesting things have happened... I don't think interesting is the right word, because it's more like some bad things have happened.  1. Yesterday my mum took me to the emergency department, which I was in for about 6 hours. I've been in the ED before but last time nothing changed, so I'm hoping that something happens this time.  2. Apparently the police did get involved, and that kind of scares me.  3. I had to apologize for writing the goodbye note.  4. There is a chance that I won't be allowed back at my drama, because of complaints and if that happens I won't ever see my friends again, and I won't ever get to see him, who is the only one I could talk to. I'm really scared.  5. If I am allowed back, a couple of my friends want to talk to me face to face, but they don't realise how much I don't want to do that. I really just want to isolate myself and stop talking for the rest of my life. Drastic I know, but I'm scared, embarrassed and feeling quite stupid.  If I had know this would have happened before I sent the note, I honestly wouldn't have said it. Drama is my life, and I don't know how to live without it. Fingers crossed I don't have to.    - a very scared Nik         Mark this post as helpful           white knight  Community Champion                 6808 posts        19 November 2019

If that does not happen then that groups organisers and those friends aren’t worth your time.  Move on. In life people move away, friendships come and go, that isafact of life Nik.

Can you tell us how it went on at the ED?  "Drama is my life, and I don't know how to live without it". - Thank you for sharing this.  In all that's gone wrong lately this feels like the thing that has gone right.  Because it's telling me and showing me straight up that this is really something you want to live for.  What is the next step?  One thing that you could potentially do is talk to the school counsellor - they'll be able to have a chat with the drama teacher privately and hopefully help you back in, especially knowing how important it is to you.  I know you don't want to face your friends.  It's not drastic, it's understandable.  But flip it - if this had happened to one of your friends, don't you think you'd want to see them too?  I know I sure would.  Even if it was hard.  RT        3  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Aaronsis  Community Champion            630 posts        20 November 2019

                                    in reply to ~Nik~     Hi Nik  I am so glad that you have come back to chat and I can hear how scared and how overwhelmed you are right now.  I feel kind of disappointed to be honest that you perhaps will not be allowed back to the drama class, I understand a need to address the issue and like White Knight suggested something like "yeh, sorry about that, it wasnt the right thing to do, I wasnt feeling well ". I dont think that excluding you and asking you to leave is a very supportive environment or shows very caring or accepting people at a time when you were not feeling great, you reached out but with confusion and made a mistake. It is hard for people to acknowledge suicide and thoughts of suicide and what their role in that means, and this scares the hell out of people and they don't know how to respond, I think you are seeing that clearly now.  I am so very sorry this has all gone a bit pear shaped for want of a better word and turned out like this for you, I would have hoped people would be more understanding and supportive.  I think one step at a time and try not to role play in your head what you "think might happen" and just take it one step at a time and deal with the issues as they present themselves, as it may turn out differently than you are thinking.  I think also with some time they will calm down too and hopefully things can return to how they were for you in the drama class.  I hope you have a plan in place to take care of yourself so as when you are feeling so very vulnerable and like you are going to hurt yourself you can reach for your plan and execute it and know it is a good one and that you are supported.  Huge hugs for you Nik  Hope to chat to you some more  Sarah      2  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           ~Nik~     10 posts        20 November 2019

                                    in reply to romantic_thi3f     Hi,  What what on at the ED?  Well, I stayed there for six hours, in the same chair, in the same room, I seriously lost track of time.  1. There was a doctor, she took my blood pressure, my weight, that sorta stuff.  2. There was a mental health person, who talked to me and I had to explain everything that was going on and talk about why I was there and what was happening, so I explained everything; the voices in my head, my depression, my anxiety, my issues with eating, my insomnia, and my autism  3. Then a social worker came to see me, because I said something about my parents fighting, so we talked about a traumatic event that happened when I was a child.  4. Another doctor came in, offered me food (like a hundred times) I said no.  5. I slept (It's true, I was so tired, both mentally and physically)  6. Then I left    It was a tiring experience, and I don't think anything will change.  - Nik         Mark this post as helpful           smallwolf  Community Champion                 3063 posts        20 November 2019

                                    in reply to ~Nik~     Hi Nik,  Regarding he note you wrote - putting aside whatever the content was, there was a reason why you wrote it and perhaps a cry for help, a reaction to everything that was going on in your life. Since my 20s, I would have suicidal thoughts, but never acted on them. My reason for not talking about it was that I was concerned what everyone would think of or about me. Add 25+ years to now... the emotional pain was too great (?) and found I needed to talk to someone. Now I talk to a psychologist periodically and refer to myself as a work in progress.  That wanting to be by yourself is something I can understand and I have done that on more than one occasion. "Unfortunately" the thing to do is the opposite, so says my psychologist for a short while - doing things that give meaning to you etc. can act as a both a distraction and coping mechanism.  Finally, on the parents ... I am sure that your parents do care about what you are going through if you told them. It is possible to both tell them and not tell them at the same time. Know that sounds confusing. Just before I was put onto anti-depressants was a really bad time wrt. suicidal thoughts. The next chat I had with mum I only to mention suicidal thoughts and that was enough for her as she did not want to worry about me. As for the details there are only 4 people who know my thoughts and actions at that time - 3 of those persons are in the mental health sphere. So I (and sure you) will work out the boundaries of how much to say to whom. You are worth more than you think, and your parents would say the same.  It takes courage to ask for help when things to wrong. It takes strength to admit is a mistake. Regardless of what happens next, you are supported and accepted here.

I am visiting a pediatrician, and they were talking about starting medication (the mental health people at the ED were talking about it too) and I really want to try it, because I am at the stage where I am sick of being like this and I really want it to be over, but my mum doesn't want me to do it, because she's afraid that it'll be hard to take me off it. Is there anything I can say to her, to make her change her mind?  - Nik         Mark this post as helpful           Aaronsis  Community Champion            630 posts        21 November 2019

                                    in reply to ~Nik~     Hey Nik  I feel like you are sounding really positive about what is coming up for you and the process to get things in place for you and that is so wonderful.  I get that your mum is scared and she is worried about the medication, is there some information that the doctors have given you that you could perhaps sit and read with her? You could speak to your doctor too and ask them to spend some time with your mum to go through the medication with her and what it will do and how you will come off and what the process is.  Sometimes it is just the fear of the unknown V's the fear of the medication itself.  It would be great if she could get some support too and she is probably worried about his process as well and how it will impact you, not only just the medication.

                                    in reply to ~Nik~     Hi Nik,  Not a professional so cannot really tell you about antidepressants but I can relate my experience to you...  Firstly the most important thing to do is to understand the side effect. Remember these are possibilities also.  If you want to change from one medication to another you will wean off the first and start on the second. Something I have had to do a few times and you would be told how to by the person prescribing the medication.  It is natural for your mother to be worried about you and educating yourself is the best way to work out what you are dealing with. And my psychiatrist also says that medication also works best when you do talk therapy as well. Don't be afraid to ask questions.

Only if you want to , can you tell me a bit more about what happened with you snapping at him? Was it warranted, where you standing up for yourself?  Was it uncalled for?  I see you said that you didn't have any reason for it but something must have triggered you or you felt something to react to?  It would be good if you can identify what it might be so you can manage it for next time.  I think either way you perhaps just need to talk to your friend and explain how it came to be that you snapped at him, if you are at fault that is fine, you can say that, you can say you made a mistake, everyone does it.  I am pretty sure that you have not made  your friends life rubbish and that he does not hate you.  You are most certainly not stupid Nik, everyone makes mistakes and you snapped, no problem, have a chat to him and address it and give him a hug to apologize.  I am so sorry you are feeling so very anxious about this but I am sure too that it can be repaired.

                                    in reply to Aaronsis     Hey,  I saw him yesterday and the day before, and things were fine between us, but I am still scared that he is a bit wary of me, and not as close as we used to be.  What happened that day was this:  I wanted to speak to him after our performance like I always do, so we went out to a couch area and sat down. He told me he didn't have much time because he needed to catch a tram or a train (don't remember which) and they only ran every hour, he also didn't want to leave our other friend waiting (whom was catching the train with him). He told me not to be discouraged by that, and to still tell him what I need to say. So I told him that he lied to me, when he told me he'd help me do something, and I asked him if he would forget, and he said no, and then the day comes when it was supposed to happen, and he never brought it up. I knew he didn't forget, because this thing mattered a lot to him, as much as it mattered to me, and he wanted me to get better. So I told him he lied to me, and that he didn't do it. He said he couldn't force me to do anything. So I got angry ( because he always says that, and I feel like it's an excuse, but I know I am overreacting) and told him he couldn't force me to live either and to stop trying to. His voice got very quiet and hurt, and he said "You know everything I do for you is to help you". So I told him to stop helping me. He didn't reply and just looked really tired, and fed up and he put his head in his hand. I stood up, and grabbed my bag. Then we both left silently. I used the walk down the stairs to calm down, and by the time we got out of there, I apologized. He said you don't have to be sorry. Then he went to leave. I said "i..." (it was like an attempt to say something, but my voice decided not to work and I decided not to say anything). He goes, I would give you a hug, but you don't like your mum seeing you. I said I didn't care. So he hugged me, for a very short time, and then left. Our hugs are usually longer, or so I thought, so know of course I am scared he hates me.  Yesterday, I didn't get a very good hug either, and it was only a goodbye hug, because he used to hug me when we met, but not any more.  The day before that, I did get a better hug, but i'm wondering if it were going to be similar to out normal ones had we not had to go on stage a few seconds later.  I don't know what to think. I think I'm over analyzing everything.  -  Nik         Mark this post as helpful           Aaronsis  Community Champion            630 posts        5 December 2019

                                    in reply to ~Nik~     Hey Nik  I can hear how this strained relationship with your friend is really impacting you and I am so sorry it is really making you emotional and run scenarios through your head and think alot about this and the friendship and what is going on and what he is thinking and where you go from here.  There is a sure lot going on here and I sort of got a little lost in the actual events that you described, I am having trouble understanding what he lied to you about and how he agreed to do something with you or for you and forgot.  I then hear you say he is trying to help you and get you alive and you don't want him to do that?? I am understanding this correctly, sorry to make you explain i am a little lost.  I can see though that he is still hugging you and embracing you, and it may take some time to repair the friendship if it has been strained lately, but he is still there for you and has not abandoned you at this time which is wonderful.  Perhaps you need a conversation with some more time where you are both not rushed and you perhaps need to let him know how important to you he is and that you are feeling sad about the friendship and the events that have gone on lately.  I think some time and a good chat will help get your relationship back on track, it is so tricky to manage these things but I think you just have to let him know how you are feeling and that you miss and care for him.

                                    in reply to Alir88     Hi Alir88,  Welcome to the forums and thank you for your post and your question.  To answer your question, there is no normal when it comes to mental health.  For people who have depression, having thoughts of suicide or self-harm is really common.  You'll probably find if you have a scroll through some of the threads on Beyond Blue you'll see lots of people who have been through (or going through) the same thing.  As to why we have these thoughts, well - our brain likes to solve problems.  It works to solve problems and come up with solutions, even if those solutions aren't ideal.  Self-harm is a solution where you can focus on the pain in your body instead of the pain in your mind, or numb out, while taking your own life is a solution where you don't have to live anymore.  Unfortunately both of these solutions aren't great (bit of an understatement!!), but right now that's the only ones your brain can see.  As your brain thinks of better solutions and you find more coping skills, you'll find that you have these thoughts less and less.  You said in your post that you don't want to die right now, and I'm really glad to hear that.  If you can think about all the reasons and keep reminding yourself of them, the idea and thoughts of suicide can be less appealing.  I hope that this answers your question.  Given what you are going through, everything is totally normal.  I hope that you'll reach out to whatever support you need to help you get through this time.

                                    in reply to Alir88     Hi Alir88,  You asked if it was normal...It is a difficult question to answer, as our normal could be said to be based on our experiences. Here is mine -  You could say that nothing was really wrong with me until a couple of years ago. Prior to that there were periods during the year when I would feel low, feeling flat, empty, lump in the throat. I thought it was something that everyone went through. Having a mental illness did not cross my mind. Then one night I was very quiet, worried about things, even my wife noticed. So I looked up the symptoms and would find my way to the K10 test on the beyond blue web site. It said I should see a GP, and so I did that and was then referred to a psychologist for a 2nd opinion. The psychologist told me to go back to my GP and get a mental health plan. The long and the short of it has been a diagnosis of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. In the time since then I have been seeing the psychologist periodically and working through these issues.  So I thought that every feeling and thought I had over the last X years was normal. That everyone had similar thoughts. At the same time, I felt I could not express my feeling because nobody else did. So it was only after I went to a psychologist I would work out or find out that my normal was not quite normal, as my response to a situation was disruptive and negative - rather than taking things in my stride it was the end of the world.  Now the good news is that I am working on it with the help of my psychologist. Will I be normal like .... ? Dunno.So the answer to your question is your response to stressful events is normal for you, and there is hope, and you will be supported along the way by the people here.

I guess the idea of suicide/self harm has become so much part of my thinking that i think it's 'normal' and that everyone thinks that way and self-harm seems to give me a sort of high and distracts me from my inner pain for a while. I am kinda scared though, that one day i will impulsively do something that i won't be able to come back from.

It is important to have a plan for those times when you experience urges to harm yourself.

                                    in reply to Alir88     Hi Alir88,  It's great to hear back from you.  I hope you don't mind me asking, but at the moment, are you thinking of self-harm, or are you self-harming?  I'm asking because both thinking about it and self-harming can both give you a bit of a high, but actually self-harming can be dangerous at times.  It's okay if you don't want to respond to this question.  Lots of the members here and Sophie_M has listed lots of support services too.

                                    in reply to Alir88     Hi Alir88,  Do you have anyone you are able to talk to about what you go though? Or are going through? I find that talking to someone very helpful - things that I cannot tell my family, some for reasons of choice and then others. So being able to talk to someone and in this case my psychologist or psychiatrist allows me to get things off my chest so to speak.  The other thing my psychologist suggested to me as an app that I still use today. If you are interested I could tell you the name of the app - it just has a bunch of useful tools for coping (at least for me).  Lastly, have you looked at alternatives to self-harm? Like holding an ice cube in your hand or elbow.  Sitting with you,  Tim      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Alir88     21 posts        25 November 2019

                                    in reply to Alir88     Hi Alir88  It is great that you are back to chat and that you have been talking to a counsellor and that you have started to make your journey to wellness, this is not easy and you are so brave for putting you first.  I am not sure of the app that Tim referred to but there is a wonderful app on the Beyond Blue site called the suicide safety plan..here is the link  https://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support/beyondnow-suicide-safety-planning  I am so proud of you Alir88 and that you are reaching out and responding to help. Counselling does feel weird to start with, it will start to flow as you get to know your therapist, however we don't always connect with the first therapist that we meet so if you don't feel like you are making a connection and they are helping please keep on trying until you find one that works for you.  I does kind of feel like a beef session and that you are complaining, I guess in a way when we purge we are getting the complaints out....keep at it Alir88, it is so great you are doing this for you.

                                    in reply to Alir88     The app I was referring to is called  Virtual hope box  And it was recommended to me by my psychologist. It has a bunch of distraction tools, meditations etc. If you google the name you can find out more and is based on a physical hope box.  U was talking with my psychiatrist today and was telling her that the stuff we talk about is not really something I can talk to wife about. Yet. Well I can but there are boundaries I don't cross either to scare her or make her think I am weird.  Anyway I get what you were saying and if you give yourself time you will find ways of talking and moving on.

                                    in reply to smallwolf     I'm sure if my husband could see in my head, he would run as far away as he could cause it gets pretty messy in there. Sometimes i think 'why do you trust me, if you knew what i was thinking of doing, you wouldn't let me out of your sight' I guess because he doesnt think the way i do, so thoughts of suicide and self harm prob don't cross his mind.

Just with regards to your comment about if your partner could see in your head he would not let you out of his site.  I was just wondering if this is such a bad thing while you are feeling like this, is there maybe a conversation that you can have with your husband and while you may not disclose every detail, the fact that you said he would not let you out of his site shows he would care for you and have compassion and yes worry too, but having him on your team would be a great support to you????  I know you are seeing a counsellor but how would you feel about seeing a GP and having a chat and getting some support from them?  I know this is scary but it would be so worth it.

Can I suggest to you the shock that your husband would feel if he received the information that you were to go to a psychiatric hospital and he absolutely no knowing or understanding that you were having troubles and needed some support? I am not suggesting that you have to tell him everything, but I feel like talking to him about somewhat how you are feeling and that you are needing some support and that you are seeing a therapist, he is your husband and he loves you and I am so very sure will want to support you through this time.  I would feel very sad if I didn't know that my partner was struggling and were to be admitted to care and I didn't know, I am just perhaps asking you to consider him too in your journey.  I don't think it would give you any label, so I am not sure about that, I think you are a person who is going through a rough time and needs some extra support, no one is going to think less of you for asking for help.  I am sure it would be a scary thought to have to go to a facility that is not your home, however you would be surrounded by professionals and people who are able to help you, that is all, they are very welcoming and are there to help.

I am so very sorry that you are not feeling some sort of relief from the meds as yet.  Do you think perhaps a call to Lifeline might help?  Just to perhaps talk to a person.  You will feel the comfort in their words and this time on the phone could act as a distraction for you too, along with perhaps getting some new tips even.  I am sending you much support and love Alir88, you are so brave and even though you don't feel it, you are so strong and I am proud of you, for reaching out and keeping on putting one foot in front of the other.  Huge hugs  Sarah         Mark this post as helpful           Alir88     21 posts        1 December 2019

                                    in reply to Aaronsis     Thanks for your support Sarah. I'm out of town Until thursday and i don't want to see a different gp, cause my knows all my history so i have to wait till i get home to see him. Maybe i will contact lifeline tomorrow when i am alone. I am really tired of trying though and kinda think sometimes it should be easier if i just didn't wake up. Sorry dark thoughts, but it helps to write then out Alir88         Mark this post as helpful            Close                 Page Posts page 1 (current) Posts page 2  Next posts  Last posts
Topic: I need to be admitted into a mental facility!!!!   5 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        MysticMark     9 posts        2 December 2019    Hi All, Some background: I am on the Centrelink DSP, on various medications for my mental health, I have a GP and Clinical Psychologist. My next Psychologist visit is in 2 weeks. I separated from my ex two years ago and the settlement process with lawyers is still going. She earns very well, enjoys emotionally blackmailing and abusing me and belittles my metal health. She has had several options to end the settlement matter of our separation, agreed to a settlement and now changed her mind and wants to take the matter to court. She will finally bankrupt me and deliberately make false allegations against me for 'emotional abuse' which she has told me. This stressor has sent me over the edge and I now want to end it all, I have had it. How can I admit myself for a few days in a psych ward type facility. I need to be sedated and monitored as I am going crazy. Thanks.         Mark this post as helpful           Sophie_M  Community Moderator            1396 posts        2 December 2019

        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        Regulatemyconfusion     1 posts        4 December 2019    My entire life, my mental health has been getting worse. My father passed at 11, immigrated here at 12, homeless at 16..  I'm in a situation where I'm stuck on the dole and haven't had work for over a year. I'm stuck in a cycle where I'm broke, bills are paid and I have money for food yet I order pizza... then almost starve myself for two weeks.  Some days I can't wait to get out of bed then somedays... I just don't want to get out of bed and just think of little scenarios in my head of me killing myself.  It's a back and forth cycle, I go from being well to screwing up... repeat.  When I have cash, after I have paid bills, I spend it on useless crap, constantly leaving myself guilty and ashamed of myself when it hits me that the only calories I have is from coffee and sugar.  I lie, to my friends and my mother who I constantly tell on the phone that everything is fine but I'm so alone.  I'm intelligent and I think too much, no one is hiring me for basic minimal positions and it's driving me crazy.  I don't think about life anymore, I just complain all the time to everyone. I lie to friends, to say "oh yea, I have this job" and "oh yeah, I did this now" but I don't.  I think there's something wrong with my brain. I don't clean my apartment, not because I ignore it but because I don't even think of it. It doesn't bother me.  I dated a girl for three months and it moved fast, she had me cooking meals for myself everyday (I just did it), she cooked me meals too. I almost reengaged with life.. but then she moved into my apartment and became distant. Found out she cheated on me, had BPD. So a few hours after she moved out, I almost tried to kill myself. I was so close to doing it too but I was too much of a coward to do that even. This was in early June. We were supposed to rent together so I ended up renting with a random in August.  Ever since then, all I have done is look for work in the morning (to no avail), play video games and starve. It's getting to the point where I look at friends that are a few years younger than me, succeeding, with careers and cars, families. And here I am, alone on a computer at 25.  It's so bad, I have a bad case of Pityriasis rosea on me but I've spent the money for it's medication, a 3 day treatment.. on fast food for the last 2 months. It's now visible on the sides of my neck and it's making me anxious about leaving the house.

Topic: First session jitters   3 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        wallflower_70     5 posts        4 December 2019    So, off and on over the last couple of years I have had periods where I am spinning my wheels and things get pretty dark. About 2 months ago I was getting progressively worse, and in a way that I was no longer able to really function at work. I was ridiculously anxious about even the most mundane things and on the verge of tears (and proper meltdowns) during the day; unable to think, concentrate or come to decisions. Im in a fairly high pressured job where I am required to do all of those things, so things were definitely less than ideal.  I had recently quit my gym (think performance based and a close knit community) because I was feeling like a failure in every session and ended up pretty much walking out crying most days (and binge eating my way through the day after). Whilst I was having a coffee, noise cancelling head phones on and reading the paper in my local cafe, pretty much my happiest time of the day, I was scrolling through my phone and my FB timeline. My old gym were doing some kind of 6 or 8 week challenge and had posted this 'thought provoking'-post along the lines of "where will you be in 5 years time if you keep up the habits from this challenge". I looked at the post and went; "I'll be dead" - very matter of factly and even when I took a moment to rethink that statement it sounded 'right' and inevitable. And went back to reading the paper.  Later that day at work I went into full crying meltdown because someone's spoon was scraping against a bowl and I couldnt get my noise cancelling head phones to work. That, and some of the other behaviors that I was exhibiting (anxiety, binge eating, isolating myself, quitting things I used to enjoy, gaining a lot of weight quickly) made the little remaining rational voice in me think the things were maybe not as normal and okay as I thought and that I was maybe in a bit of trouble.  So I went to see the GP. Something I had never envisaged doing or happening.  He felt I needed to be on meds.  So now I am. And I feel a lot better.  Its been about a month now and even though part of things may still be a placebo effect, I undoubtedly feel better. More of often than not anyway. I feel in control again. And it's a massive relief.  The GP felt that now that I am of clearer mind, the next step should be seeing a professional and get to the root of things. Rationally, I agree, but because I now feel so much better, am worried I am no longer 'troubled' enough to see a psychologist.  Am I being silly?

                                    in reply to wallflower_70     To clarify the above, my inability to function has returned and I'm having more good than bad days which Im seeing as a massive win.  The dark thoughts and considering ending my life are still there in the background. Please note, Im not an immediate danger to myself as I have had these feelings off and on for quite a long time and have pledged years ago that I will not act upon them until my parents are gone. It would kill my mum and I could never do that to her.  My brother has had some mental health challenges of his own and has threatened with suicide with regularity over the years and I have seen what it has done to her. She has made me go and find him once because she was convinced he had acted upon it . He hadnt, but I am sure you get the picture of what state each of us was in. Not a day I think back on with a great fondness. Hence the pledge.          Mark this post as helpful           Katyonthehamsterwheel     94 posts        4 December 2019

I feel like lately my very bad thoughts are lurking there in the background, as with you. I think that indicates that things aren't as good as they could be and I'm always a little scared those thoughts will tip to the fore. I think that that in itself is a good reason to just "check in" with someone and have a chat, and see what strategies and techniques might push things further in the direction of better. Not sure it helps, but there you go. Best, Katy      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful            Close

I have taken antidepressants on and off over this time. I am seeing a psychiatrist who has adjusted dosages and added different medications, 1 for bi-polar, 1 for epilepsy and a couple of anti-depressants.  Side effects are, a dry mouth (and I mean DRY), shaking hands, drowsiness, memory problems (forgetting things and not being able to find the word I want)  On top of this I am still suffering depression. I have been to CBT sessions but didn't find it helpful.  I have thoughts of harming myself, thoughts of moving away from my family - running away.  I have zero people to talk to. I'd like to talk to a good female friend but I am scared in case it was to change our friendship.  I really don't know what to do. How do I get through this? What else can I do?

                                    in reply to Man with no name     Hi Man with no name,  Depression can make us feel like we are alone and like no one can help us. It can be hard to open up to family and friends as we do not know how they are going to react or treat us. You could try talking with your friend and see what happens.  Hopefully you will feel welcome and supported here on this forum and in this community.  Unfortunately medication can cause side effects and it does take a while for the right tablets to be found sometimes.  Can you ask your Dr or the chemist if there are ways to counteract the side effects you are experiencing? One time I talked to the Dr and changed the time of day I took my medication, and that made a difference.  My experience is that I needed to keep using the CBT and other strategies before they started to make sense and were beneficial. It all seemed a bit strange at first, now I find it helpful.  When you are really struggling, would you consider using the phone support services on 1300 22 4636? I have found the people there to be very helpful. It was awkward at first calling them, but they certainly helped me!  Depression can make you feel like you need to run away! Sometimes I would go for a long walk or a drive and then return home again.  Hope you can find some distractions to help you through.  All the best from Dools           Mark this post as helpful           Nurse Jenn  Health professional            288 posts        13 December 2018    Hi Man with no name,  Its good to hear you posting on the forums and are reaching out for support.  Depression is such a journey and it sounds like you are on a difficult part of your experience with it at the moment.  20 years is along time and I really hear that you are struggling with you side effects and symptoms by having negative thoughts.  I agree with Dools in that revisiting your psychiatrist, requesting a medication review or even a second opinion could be of benefit.  There are some pharmacists who will do a medication review and look at some strategies to reduce side effects.  Persistence in getting some resolution or improvement to the side effects is really important.  I do understand that finding the energy to do this is very difficult when your mood is low.  Having a person to talk to can make a world of difference and to start I would try calling the beyondblue support line 1300 22 4636 . You can use this service regularly and it may give you some strength to develop a plan of action towards making some improvements to you low mood and side effects.  As far as talking to your good female friend, this is a decision only you can make but if she is a person you trust and have a good relationship with, then likely they would want to support you through the difficult time you are having.  Having a poor memory due to the medication can makes things even more difficult as your experience with the medication at appointments may be difficult to recall.  Creating a side effect register (just tracking symptoms in a daily diary) can be useful for when you next see you psychiatrist so they not only hear about your symptoms but can see in your diary how often they occur and the impact they have on your life. This way your psychiatrist knows the full picture and work towards adjusting medications to reduce the side effects and improve your quality of life.  You have already taken a big first step by posting on the beyondblue forum, reaching out further and talking to someone on the beyondblue support line or your friend may really help you to gain some clarity on next steps.  If you are struggling to talk to anyone, keep reaching out on this forum as there are so many people on here to listen and support you.  I am optimistic that with persistence, your side effects can improve and you might even find a new strategy to try such as mindfulness or a support group?  Please let us know how you go.

I'm still having trouble. I'm not feeling suicidal but I do think of harming myself. My meds have been changed around a bit more, i'm still on 4 types. 1 got changed 2 months ago which has helped as far as i am able to have a good time/laugh/joke, although this is probably only half an hour on each day. But it has made me SO lethargic. I have no motivation to do anything apart from the necessary things. I am stuck in this flat mood where nothing interests or excites me. The latest depression med is supposed to motivate me, but i've only just started it so i'm not sure yet if it works. It has made me feel very weird (wasted) though. I can't see another psychologist for a second opinion as they are just too hard to get in to see., let alone the cost. My current one costs me $180 each visit.  I don't have anyone to open up to. It feels like this is never going to end, i'm just in this cycle of various levels of depression. There's no light at the end of the tunnel.

                                    in reply to Man with no name     Hi Man with no name  I have to start with a bit of a 'Grrr!' regarding the medical system. I'm not a hater just somewhat frustrated a little. I feel that if meds are handed out, they should come with a bit of an education that could sound a little like this:  'Okay, this med typically slows people's metabolism leading them to function with slightly lower energy levels. This one often messes with the memory a little because it does this and that.' And so on.  I'm a firm believer that necessary meds should be balanced with certain natural therapies/strategies and things be well explained, giving you a sense of reason and personal empowerment. I'd love to hear 'Here are some memory exercises in order to help. Here are a few natural mental and physical ways to help boost your metabolism (such as massage therapy, a walk around the block daily and so on)'. They're not too demanding, especially the massage part. Sounds especially good.  The side effects of meds can leave us feeling pretty confused as to why they can be messing with us. A basic understanding when it comes to how we tick should be part of the treatment, in my opinion. I know, a little time consuming for the gp but, hey, I believe we're owed a little more when our desire is to live as fully as possible. Anyhow, don't mean to sound ranty.  Give some thought to having a massage. Sounds simple for sure but it's a great way to activate multiple systems in the body as well as being seriously relaxing.  :)         Mark this post as helpful           Jen-     12 posts        3 December 2019

                                    in reply to Man with no name     Taking meds is really tough and I empathize with what you’re going through right now. My anti-depressants before used to make me feel either half-asleep or brain dead at times, which was very hard as my work requires me to always be alert and come up with solutions on the spot.  I learned Later on to research drug side effects for some people and to note the effects they have on me. If it is negative and something I can’t live with, I’d ask my GP for an alternative, but still, going through those up and down situations must be extremely difficult for you. Perhaps you can note what your side effects are and share this with your doctor.    I do think you should probably open up to your friend. Support is very important and helpful in making you better and if she is your friend, she would definitely care about what you’re going through and be there for you.      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Doolhof  Community Champion                 7212 posts        4 December 2019

                                    in reply to Man with no name     Hi Man with no name,  I'm sorry to read you are struggling so much with depression and your medications. Hopefully you can find ways to push through the dullness and lethargy.  Has the Dr discussed the side effects with you and if they might ease off or not?  Sometimes I think we need to ask ourselves if we can live with the depression without the medication or do we need it regardless of the side effects.  I'm wondering if the drugs might be different if Drs were required to trial them before they prescribed them.  Another point is that unfortunately everyone can react differently to the same medication!  Are you eligible for a Mental Health Care Plan from your GP where you can receive reduced costs for psychologists and sometimes have appointments bulk billed.  Has the same person prescribed all of your medications? Just wondering if you have different people prescribing pills for you.  Talking to the pharmacist may help you understand the side effects as well.  Hope you find some energy and enthusiasm.

                                    in reply to Doolhof     Thanks for the replies.  The Dr does let me know what the common side effects and I have not taken some he's suggested due to the likely side effects. I have managed to go without meds a few times for couple of years but always lapse and need to go back on them.  I did get put on a Care Plan a few years ago but wasn't very impressed with the treatment so have not tried again. All of my meds are prescribed by the same Dr.  It's frustrating having Dr & psychiatrist appointments as well as having to get blood tests done on top of some other health problems which also require appointments and a day surgery. I spend more time at Dr's than anyone I know!         Mark this post as helpful           therising  Valued Contributor            684 posts        4 December 2019

                                    in reply to Man with no name     Hi Man with no name  Thought it might help to mention a strategy my mum and I use when she goes to see a specialist or gp. By the way she has a lot of appointments and this was seriously getting her down to the point where it became her life or one could say her identity. I mentioned to her one day whilst at a specialist appointment, 'Every time you have an appointment, we will go for coffee somewhere or lunch. This way we are going for a coffee or lunch and before hand we pop into the specialist or gp'. This had significant psychological impact. The treat became the focus and the appoint was a matter of 'by the way' or the secondary focus (not the main). So now she more so enjoys identifying herself as a coffee goer or social luncher. Yes, very simplistic but enough to raise her spirits and dopamine levels in her brain. And yes, it's become a little expensive here and there with the eating and coffee drinking but the benefits are priceless, as she was becoming quite depressed before this new strategy.  :)      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Doolhof  Community Champion                 7212 posts        4 December 2019

Sometimes I pack a picnic lunch or even a coffee in a thermos and a snack and find somewhere nice to have that.  Depending on where the appointment is and other priorities I try to go for a walk as well, or make myself look in a shop or take a different route home in the car.  It does help!

You could ask the place you received assistance if they have another worker available or ask your Dr for a different recommendation as you did not find the last person helpful.  It would have been beneficial if I had done this myself instead of just walking away feeling really annoyed and disgruntled!         Mark this post as helpful            Close

From what my husband has said I believe he has PTSD from the trauma in his childhood and early life. He is now 58 and has never dealt with any of it and refuses to seek any professional help. He self medicates with alcohol. I am the only person who knows even a limited amount of what he's been through and I feel overwhelmed at the gravity of the situation. Although I have a fare amount of experience with depression and anxiety, I know little about PTSD and what will help him apart from professional treatment. Any advice on how I can help him - ie what not to do and what to do would be greatly appreciated. Noting again he refuses to talk to or see anyone else about it and has basically threatened he will go through with the suicide if I do tell anyone.  Thanks in advance.

                                    in reply to Devena     Hi Devena  I am so very very sorry at what you have experienced over the weekend with your husband, how very terrifying.  I am so glad at a time when you are forbidden to tell anyone about this you have reached out here to get some support, and I am not sure how much help I can be as I am not a professional, just a person who cares.  The thing is that there is not alot that you can do for him if he infact does not want it, as scary as that sounds it is true, what you can do is seek some help on how to manage this and how to life with him and get some professional support for you, to keep you well and to know that this is not your fault and you most certainly cannot make him do anything.  I think too that some help for you will help you process his life's events as you mentioned you are very overwhelmed at the gravity of the situation.  Even thought I can hear you say you do have some experience with depression and anxiety, it really is different for everyone which is why helping you will be a great start.  Making sure you are well and can therefor be the best emotional support to him, as best as you can in this situation.  I am so sorry that he has said to you that if you tell anyone he will go through with the suicide, this is so very much pressure for you and not fair for him to place this restriction on you seeing that you are living this pain too and need some support.  Can you talk to him from that point?  That you need to have support to be able to love and support him and if he refuses to get some help that is his choice but you need to talk about it with a professional.  Perhaps some numbers for him in the event that he does decide he wants to talk, like Lifeline 13 11 14, or the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467...you just never know that by giving him these details he might use them.  They are so very wonderful.  The pain and hurt you must be going through is so very much and I am so sorry this is happening to you and to your husband too, it is just so horrific.  Big hugs to you Devena and please come back anytime to chat, we are here for you to comfort and support you through this really rough time.

                                    in reply to Devena     Hi Devena,  So sorry to read what you up against presently. I agree with everything that AS mentioned in the previous and will only add the following. A couple of links you might like to look at are:  https://www.suicidecallbackservice.org.au/resource/discussing-suicide-how-to-talk-to-somebody-about-suicide/  https://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/suicide-prevention/worried-about-someone-suicidal  On the beyond blue you will also find information so that you can look after yourself. There are a few reasons why a person might not want to talk about suicide. If I think about myself it would be  shame, guilt, embarrassment, feeling weak because I could not cope. These reasons might sound "invalid" but can be what someone thinks. Your husband is not the first person or last person who may feel they cannot speak to anyone, but is not alone in those thoughts. If you can get through whatever the reason is he cannot talk about it then things may change.  Tim         Mark this post as helpful           Devena     3 posts        27 November 2019    Thank you for your replies.  Just knowing that someone has heard is a relief for me. Trying to keep it all together is exhausting.  After the shock of the suicide attempt on the weekend, I am scared to go home from work each day, not knowing if I'll find my husband dead or alive. He does seem a little more settled now but he didn't seem unsettled on the weekend either so it all feels so unpredictable.  I will take the advice you've given, particularly the part about taking care of myself so I am equipped to be there for him.  Thanks so much.

                                    in reply to Devena     Hi Devena  It is great to chat to you again, I can hear how terrified you are to go home each day and not knowing what you are going to find, that is just terrifying and must be filled with so much fear and anxiety, I am so sorry this is happening to you and to your husband too.  I am trying to think of something that you can put in place to relieve the anxiety of your arrival home, the only thing I can think of is a call on the way home to your husband to perhaps chat, that way you can perhaps have some comfort in knowing he is ok, that you are not going to find something horrific when you walk in the door.  I am also not sure how you feel about this but can you tell your husband how terrified that you are about what you are coming home to and how it is making you feel?  I am not sure how you feel about this but it might help to have a conversation with him to talk this through and how the events from the weekend have left you in such a state that you are scared to come home.  I am so pleased to hear that you are going to consider yourself too and put some things in place to ensure you are looked after at this time too, even if it is something like a coffee with a friend or a hair appointment, something that makes you feel good.  Ultimately it would be great to get some support for your doctor too as they have some great tools to help you through this time.

I can relate as I've had all of that too.Not wanting to wake up and face it all again was a familiar feeling.  I guess I could spout out a whole load of generalities, but I doubt they would be much help, I'd really like it is you were to talk about some of the thngs that are troubling you, who knows we may have much in common.  The only other thing I will say is I was a suicidal mess, now I'm not, I'm good.

I'm having suicidal thoughts with no intent or plan. Last time I rang beyond blue to talk I spoke to a person who wasn't very nice and shoved me into a program I couldn't go through with. It has put me off calling to talk again. That's why I just stick to the forums.  I am on medication and I take it. I'm waiting to see my new doctor. I cannot get in any earlier. I'm tired and have nothing left anymore. I'm dealing with childhood abuse by two parents. Cutting contact with my mother and can't even touch the domestic violence I left this June. I'm out of strength and I really am not coping.  I don't know what to do and I am feeling very panicked and scared.

This site does have a good forum, and people seem very helpful, which I am very thankful for.  Staying away from the source of your problems is good, and you should keep at it. If you are taking your meds and it doesn’t seem to work, you could ask your doctor for a different brand perhaps? I’ve tried a lot of them in the past before and have noticed that brand does matter (not how expensive, but the formulation I think).  Anyway, I hope things are better now today for you.

                                    in reply to Jen-     Hi Jen,  I'm not going to call. I'm too scared cause I'm too fragile at the moment. I'm using 1800 respect at the moment because I know what I'm going to get. Uncertainties are a huge trigger for me. I can't do it to myself.  As for medication, I've done my best. I paid a psychiatrist this year about four months ago to do a medication review. He said that he was satisfied with my medication, he tweaked one thing a bit.  Right now I'm just going to wait till the morning and see what the doctor has to say. He has my records now from my old doctor so I don't have to tell him the whole story. Just the recent trauma of taking in the severe childhood trauma. I have cut contact in Sunday with the remaining caregiver.  There is no clear cut path from A to B to C and so on when it comes to this. You may be at C and go to A at the same time. It's far from easy. I just keep going to get support where I can and where it is safe for me.         Mark this post as helpful           Katyonthehamsterwheel     94 posts        3 December 2019

        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        Jen-     12 posts        1 December 2019    Hi, I’m new here and I’ve never really done this before - signing up to a forum.  I’m a 36 year old single parent suffering from depression. I used to be on anti-depressant medication, went off it when I felt life was getting better and was able to maintain it for a while, but now life has thrown me quite a few curve balls I don’t know if I can handle.  I just feel so tired from living. I ask myself almost daily now why I still need to carry on with life. My daughter whom I love so much decided she wanted to stay with her dad for the next 5 years til she finishes secondary school. She lives in another state that’s 4 hours away, and I try to visit her whenever I can, but the cost of transportation and accommodation just becomes too much added to child support. I’ve thought about moving close to her, but there’s not a lot of jobs and I’m not really in the position to up and move everything given I’m not financially capable nor mentally ready to do leave Sydney. I’m really scared to, as I’ve already left to go to Australia a few years ago and have left everything I’ve ever owned or had and I don’t know if I have it in me to do it all over again.  I have no family here in Australia since I moved here a few years back except for my daughter. I also have trust issues from being cheated on by her father and my last ex-boyfriend and feel like I’m alone in this world.  I live with my current partner and he’s a good person, but I don’t think he understands me, and I don’t want to open up to him all the time as I feel he’s getting tired of always hearing about my problems. I know he has problems as well, and I don’t want to add to it anymore. He’s often away traveling or at his parents so his parents can spend time with the child as they are getting on with age. I do understand all of this, but I get awfully lonely and depressed whenever he’s gone as well. Add to that I’ve recently transferred jobs and am really unhappy with my new one.  I just ask myself nowadays why I still need to carry on in life when it seems if I disappeared today, no one will probably miss me anyway. My daughter wants to be with her father more, even though growing up he was sometimes physically and verbally abusive to her, and my partner probably won’t even care if I’m gone tomorrow.

Many people here (including me) have their own experiences with managing suicidal thoughts which makes this a safe place to reach out. No judging here just a place to feel less alone.  You mentioned stopping your meds which made me wonder if you've gone back to your doctor yet? When times are good it is easy to start thinking you don't need the meds anymore but sometimes we do.  Right now I'm worried you're at risk and I really hope you're open to talking to your GP. You said your extended family is overseas but is there anyone you trust to phone and confide in?  At my worst it was almost impossible to see that I mattered anymore. But I did. And you do too. Depression make it so hard to see any positives in ourselves but they are there.  I hope you are safe.  ❤         Mark this post as helpful           therising  Valued Contributor            684 posts        2 December 2019

                                    in reply to Jen-     Hi Jen  Sounds like you have a lot of people and situations around you both challenging you and draining you at the same time. I try to remain conscious in my own life when it comes to the challenges and who or what is draining me. This way, I remain aware of who is not playing the game of life fairly (in my opinion). One of the problems with this perception is it can lead one to feel a bit ripped off and neglected. It does have benefits though; it can also lead you to understand the huge amount of effort you are actually putting in. Jen, you're putting in far more effort than you might realise and you should feel incredibly proud of your self. You're a star.   You've risen to the challenge of moving to a new country  You're trying to rise to the incredible challenges that come with your daughter moving. I'm a mum myself, so I admire you deeply for facing something so intensely challenging  You're trying to rise to the challenge of your ex not meeting you half way (travel wise) regarding catching up with your daughter. By the way, if your ex is in a good financial position, he could reduce the child support so you can use the extra cash for meeting up with your daughter. It couldn't hurt for him to see this as investing in his daughter's mental well being  You're trying to rise to the challenge of enduring a job you don't like  You're trying to rise to the challenge of accommodating your partner whilst he chooses to visit his parents and travel often   Jen, no wonder you're feeling tired, fed up and drained. You appear to be the only one trying to rise to significant challenges. I hope you can see your star quality here.  If there is that temptation to feel a little ripped off, whilst feeling incredibly proud of your self at the same time, the best place to go is 'outside the square' (when it comes to thinking). I find outside the square is where I begin to think of the challenges I'm going to pose to others (the ones who are draining me).  Perhaps you might want to think about asking your ex to go halves in travel money so you can catch up with the daughter he loves. Perhaps you might want to challenge your partner to think of ways to travel a little less or take you with him. Or maybe you can challenge your self to find empowering pastimes, such as meeting up with a meditation group who can support you in de-stressing and getting to know your inner power. A significant challenge may involve you convincing your self that you are too good for this job you're in.  :)         Mark this post as helpful           Jen-     12 posts        2 December 2019

                                    in reply to therising     Hi therising,  Thank you for all the feedback you’ve given – you are right, I do feel tired, fed up and unappreciated. I have tried taking some of the recommendations you’ve given me such as talking to my daughter’s dad, but he’s really not the sort of person who would even feel sympathy, guilt or remorse. Let’s just say in his head, he is always right and has a halo around his head at all times.  With regards to my partner traveling, I can’t really go with him as I also maintain a full time job. I wish I had that luxury, but I don’t - I don’t really depend on my partner financially as we each both have children from different partners we support in majority.    I do really like your idea about a meditation group - I am trying to find a local support group around my area but I haven’t found any yet.

                                    in reply to Jen-     Hey Jen. Sorry that you're finding life hard at the moment. I am too  :(  Just wanted to say that if your GP doesn't listen to you properly and just offers meds which you don't particularly want, I'd be looking for another one. I've found some are much better with mental health issues than others. My current GP is amazing. She knows I'm having a hard time at the moment so she makes sure I have another appointment booked to check in with her, and she's told me I can just come and chat to her any time if I need to. Not sure if you've seen a psychologist before, but your GP can also refer you to one so you can get further support.  In regard to a meditation group, I'm not aware of any where I am either, but my psychologist usually helps me find things like that. They're usually up on what support groups etc are available locally. I go to yoga on Saturdays and find that helpful if that's something you might be into :) Katy         Mark this post as helpful           Jen-     12 posts        3 December 2019

                                    in reply to Katyonthehamsterwheel     Hi Katy,  I’ll try to come in and see a GP this weekend, and hopefully he/she might offer more than just medication.  I have tried yoga previously but I’m not sure it’s a good fit for me. It is a good exercise, but it just doesn’t alleviate my ‘situation.’  I’ve finally found a local support group and they have a meeting tom night, and it’s usually bi-monthly. I’ve never been to one of these, and I do want to go but I’m also scared to go and feeling just tired with just enough energy to get through a day at work and then come home and lie down until I fall asleep...

Can you go to this website https://wccmaustralia.org.au/ Look under meditation for groups which are listed by state. I do hope that helps. Not sure what type of meditation you would prefer but I have found meditation to be a huge anchor in my life.  These web site is the World Community for Christian Meditation Australia. Please do not be put of by the name. No one is going to preach at you or anything of the sort. They will welcome you, show you how to meditate and offer friendship.

        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        OptimisticQuail     22 posts        19 November 2019    Long story short.  I have been diagnosed with moderate-severe depression and moderate anxiety by my treating Psychologist. My Doctor has prescribed me medication which I have been taking religiously since October 10, 2019.  Although the first few weeks triggered bad thoughts leading to wanting to carry out bad actions combined with physical side effects I feel as though I have started to have little wins since November 6.  Although I am having little wins and after 4 weeks off work, I still feel empty most of the time. It's exhausting to get out of bed each day. The thought of work (even though I habe returned) is repulsive. I don't feel like giving people my time and bad thoughts pop up out of nowhere still. Although I feel I have that rationality to not carry out bad actions I keep questioning myself why?  Why don't I end this emotional struggle? My only answer is my family at the moment, however besides that the constant thoughts, lack of sleep and No desire to do anything I can't stop thinking of the 'end' which is incredibly frustrating as I am usually a laid back optimistic person.  Any advice or tips would be welcomed to get me back to my normal self. Thanks all.

I am so pleased that you are seeing a doctor and a psychologist, that is so very positive and I am glad that you are getting some help.  It does take time and I can hear how frustrated you are but please keep talking as you are doing everything right to get yourself back on the path to wellness and happiness, however it unfortunately does not happen overnight.  I am so glad that you have your family and something that is getting you through this time as they love you and need you and you matter, you are worth it so very much.  I am not sure if you have some things that you can do to make yourself feel good, maybe a trip to the beach or to the hairdresser to pamper yourself or just something small to put a smile on your face, you deserve that.  I really hope to hear back from you and and chat some more to you OptimisticQuail  Hugs  AS         Mark this post as helpful           romantic_thi3f  Community Champion                      2202 posts        20 November 2019

                                    in reply to OptimisticQuail     Hi OptimisticQuail,  Thank you for your post and I appreciate you reaching out.  I can see that Aaronsis has already given you some great support already.  Can I make a suggestion?  Write things down.  When we are in a tough place, whether that's depression, anxiety, or even thinking of suicide - our mind tends to keep going to the darkest places because it's all it knows.  It can take a while to return to 'normal' because it's rewiring the brain and letting it know that things can be better.  When you have your little win, write it down, and write the next one down, and the next one.  One day, my little win that I wrote down was that I didn't self-harm today.  That was all I could think of, and that was my little win.  99% of the time it feels ridiculous, but I look back now and I can see that those little wins add up.  I have no doubt that you've had lots of little wins too, and I also know that if you were to see them on paper you'll see that you are probably getting a new normal slowly slowly.  Hopefully this suggestion helps you or gives you something to think about!  Anytime that you notice the good things that part of your brain will get stronger and stronger.  RT         Mark this post as helpful           OptimisticQuail     22 posts        25 November 2019    Thank you so much for the kind words.  I am having little wins here and there which is great.  I have returned to work 4 days instead of 5 which is a massive help.  I Still though can not help those bad thoughts popping into my head which feels like I am fantasising of suicide.  I am at pains still to ne around people especially at work where it feels the energy (little that I have) is sucked right out of me although I am using techniques my Psychologist has given me, leading to zero motivation.  While I have little wins here and there it still feels a massive difference to being and feeling the lows. The constant emotional toll it takes is really draining.  While I keep saying I won't 'end things' the constant ideation of being numb is a fantasy I keep coming back to which worries me.  The Bad thoughts just seems to linger no matter what I do at the moment.         Mark this post as helpful           Aaronsis  Community Champion            630 posts        25 November 2019

                                    in reply to OptimisticQuail     Hello OptimisticQuail  It is great to chat to you again and I am really happy to hear that you have not only reduced your hours at work that are helping but are having some small wins, that is so wonderful.  The road to recovery is a journey and things will not "get better" overnight as you well know, but you are putting one step in front of the other and showing up to your job and to life and that is wonderful.  It is draining and being around people when you are feeling so drained is tough but your psychologist sounds like they have given you some great things to put in place that seem to be helping, and even if it is the smallest of small, that is so great as it is so better than having no tools to get through these times.  I hear that you are still having thoughts of feeling numb and that the thoughts of "ending things" are around, please try to be kind to yourself and let yourself have the time to get well.  Fall back on the tools that you have been given and come here to chat, how did you feel about RT's tip to write down when you have your wins and how it made you feel and to use this as reflection when you are feeling low and hearing those dark thoughts.  Have you managed to do some things that make you feel some peace, some joy, no matter how small.  The good things and the small wins all help in teaching your brain about the "good" rather than it wandering to other thoughts that are dark.  How the medication is going, October is not long ago so just wondering how that is settling in for you.  Great to chat to you again and huge hugs to you  AS         Mark this post as helpful           OptimisticQuail     22 posts        25 November 2019

                                    in reply to Aaronsis     Thanks Aaronsis.  I have written pros and cons down of how my week has been to then discuss with my psychologist as I'm a pretty forgetful person so a big thanks to RT there.  Medication is okay. I think it has stabilised me since around the first week into November. Was a rollercoaster those first few weeks though.  I just can't seem to let that feeling of wanting to feel numb leave me. I link it back to surgeries (ankle and shoulder reconstructions) and the feeling you get when you have a general and also the feeling you have on the strong painkillers. Feels like bliss - worry free bliss like you're floating on a cloud. I assume this is why people take drugs for that high. I never have hence the link to surgeries.  I practise mindfulness as a result of feeling at peace in the moment however it just doesn't seem fulfilling.  I feel lucky to have that rationality to not act on bad thoughts but the desire to feel numb often battles off with the hunger to be the best Dad and Husband possible.  Ahhhhhh. So conflicted and exhausted.         Mark this post as helpful           Aaronsis  Community Champion            630 posts        25 November 2019

                                    in reply to OptimisticQuail     Hey OptimisticQuail  I am so pleased that you have found a tool in writing, I too find it so very wonderful in that you can just write and purge and get it all out, however I think as RT said it is good for you to record your wins and acknowledge when you are feeling a little bit good dare i say..but to let yourself feel good and write down what it was and how it made you feel and really use these records in times when you are struggling.  I am so very proud of you to hear that you do have the hunger to be the best dad and father, that is such a credit to you and your family are so very lucky to have you.  Not only is it wonderful you are trying for you family but I hope you can see the value in you and that you deserve some peace from this and some happiness too.  It is so very exhausting and that is a great analogy to being in surgery, I get what you mean, and I suppose that is the same feeling that drug users get and hence the desire and addiction, I am pleased to hear you don't have to battle this as well, but I do get what you mean about the worry free bliss.  Mindfulness does take some practice and it really can get you to that place of worry free bliss, I understand that is it tricky and not everyone can do it, but if you keep at it and embrace it, it really is a helpful and wonderful place to be.  Good on you for trying though.  I am happy to hear that the meds are going well too, they do take some time to kick in so I am so happy for you that you are starting to get the benefits of them.  It is a journey and I am glad that you are doing everything you can for your wellness, that is so good.

                                    in reply to Aaronsis     Thanks AS (again).  I thought I was slowly getting there but the realisation following a few weeks at work is that I don't think I'm quite ready.  Today I felt overwhelmed to the point where it felt like there was a room full of kids screaming - in my head. My heart is beating noticeably fast at times, I can't concentrate and I have even shed a few tears as a result of the feeling described.  I am seeking a review of my meds and sleeping meds with my G.P tomorrow but all I feel like doing now is fighting the feeling of wanting to 'throw in the towel'... Rationally I know this is not the right option however mentally today has been one of the toughest out there.  Again, just a vent and not asking for anything but more wanting to understand why after 6ish weeks on meds I can't start to be feeling my old self. Again, a review is coming up but I am so upset and frustrated with all the effort so far to get back on track to no avail yet.  Ahhh.

I am glad that you have an appointment with your GP tomorrow, that gives me some comfort that you can have a conversation with him and get some advice on what to do.  Please don't "throw in the towel", try to reflect on the days that were hopeful and you did feel like you were improving, think of those times and know that you will have them again.  Is there someone you can call to perhaps have a coffee or a chat or just to sit and be with you?  I am so proud that you have come here to vent and I know it is not easy, you are so brave and I can really hear how hard today is for you.  I hope you can afford yourself some time off at work as you did mention you feel like you are not quite ready and that is a great realization, of how you are feeling and what you need to do, which is take some time for you.

I have visited my G.P though and he has given me another week off work, review of meds and new sleeping meds.  I'm so frustrated with the process and although I hear it takes time, I'm not very patient.  It feels like there is a fork in the road and I'm leaning towards the path of giving up more and more.  I just want the mental toughness to go away as my resilience is evaporating rapidly.  Mindfulness is a technique I try to implement with deep breathing. They help short term.

                                    in reply to OptimisticQuail     Hi OQ  I can hear how frustrated that you are and I am so very glad you have reached back out to the GP and you have some extended time off work, I am just wondering though is the time alone at home better or worse than being busy at work?  I am most certainly not questioning what your doctor has suggested but seeing you are such a determined and driven man and you want things quickly and you are wanting progress on you business and this mental health situation, I am just wondering if time away is helping or giving you a platform to think too much.  You absolutely need some time to rest and to work through your health but is a half day at work better for you, so you still have the drive and the taste for work and something that you can see moving and growing, and as a huge distraction for you too.  Just a thought.  Do you have anything fun or exciting planned for the weekend with your family, something that can bring you some small bit of happiness, maybe even a picnic or a park trip or a walk together?  I am so sorry OQ, this does take time and please...with that fork, throw it back in the cutlery draw and chose life, chose you and chose happiness, you are so very  very worth it, this is just a time in your life, not how the rest of your life is going to be.

I had previously taken 4 weeks off, went back and felt like I went backwards albeit reduces workload and responsibility.  I was just so overwhelmed and had no drive to complete even the simple tasks. Totally the opposite of my 'usual' self.  I have some home time with the family which makes me happy. Being alone though is fine. Being around people though is repulsive at times.

                                    in reply to OptimisticQuail     Hey OQ  I hear what you are saying in that you thought you were doing so well and now, even with all your techniques in place, you are feeling like you are going backwards.  I think as humans we have this expectation that a journey and healing moves forward, when you have a cold, you recover, when you have a broken bone you recover ...you move forward in the healing and the getting better phase..you move forward...the thing with mental illness is that it is not like that and the journey can go so very far forward, as we expect then even within hours go shooting back down in the other direction...the power of the brain! This is does cause us huge frustration as we can't explain it and it doesn't rationally sit well with us as we are expecting things to always move forward.  You are doing so many things right, in fact everything right and I am so very happy to hear that you have had some wonderful time with your family and that is so very important.  How is your writing going for you? Has that still been something that has been useful too? I am so sorry you are going through this, I can feel how much frustration and exasperation you are feeling and it is just not fair.

I do jot some things down on my phone which I guess is a start.  I'm just fed up with feeling intense lows, rage/anger, frustration with some small happy moments.

It is good that you are trying to hang on to these good moments and expand them,  perhaps now you can start to write about all the good things that are happening and that you are feeling, even if just a few, so that you have some things to reflect on in harder times as use it as a reminder that there are good things and that the dark times are just a time and not reality.  Yes the putting yourself first thing is tricky too, especially if you are not really that way inclined, but as you know it is kind of important now, to get the good things into you....hey...how about a trip to the local shops and get a massage, head and neck is my all time favorite and I sit there and be totally in the moment and feel the pressure release from my body...guilty  pleasure....just an idea.

Topic: Counselling and medication don't work for me   6 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        Lloyd61     1 posts        16 November 2019    Hello,  Why are we so committed to trying to save everyone. Whilst I agree that there are those that can benefit from support, but in my case I am ready to go. I am about to turn 59 and I am no longer contributing to this planet, everything upsets me and I hate what Australia is becoming.  I served 21+ years in the RAAF and have no regrets, they were the best years of my life. I need that structure and association with others with the same goal and mind set. When I left the RAAF in 1999 I joined a defence contracting company and given that majority of employees at the time were also ex military persons, so the feeling continued. But in 2008 I left due to reduced defence spending and joined a power generation company as a Project Officer. That was when the conflict began, I found it very difficult to deal with persons who were not as committed to their job and the common cause. This lasted 6 years and my position was made redundant. I then stayed within the public service and moved into the health industry as a biomedical technician. I love the job but I am still in very much conflict with others regarding attitudes towards the job. I have been seeing a psychiatrist who specialises with ex military persons. They placed me on medication, but neither their counseling nor the medication has helped. I find myself very committed to the job, but very outspoken to fellow techs who are blase about it and with senior management who are very non committal and serious with the job. To the point I am now bordering on being dismissed.  I am now into my third relationship and I can see I am upsetting my partner, it distresses me to no end, but there's nothing I can do, it is my chemistry. I require to live within a very structured life style and well laid out house. I cannot deal with mess.  So, I have tried counselling and medication, it just doesn't work for me.

                                    in reply to Lloyd61     Dear LC  I'll join Sophie_M in welcoming you here, a belated welcome, nothing to do with you or your post, just a system that does not always do what we would wish.  I guess I can understand a lot of what you have been saying, as a ex-policeman who was invalided out due to PTSD, depression and anxiety I was used to me in a team that was committed to a common cause, and by and large took it seriously. I too felt those who were casual or slapdash were at fault and in some senses letting everyone else and the cause down.  I tried to hard to be a glue that held thngs together, particularly when management was absent or demonstrated a profound lack of understanding, others took sickies or otherwise slaked off.  In the long term this contributed to my illness and invalidity, not the only reason, but a part of it.  It was not helped by being literal minded and rather too focused on any one thing, which gave excellent results, but did so at what I see now as too much cost to me  I still see people take things easy, fail to understand the gravity of matters, or cynically exploit something to their advantage. The difference now is that rather than end up suicidal and incapable of going on I confine myself to my sphere, my actions, my results. When others fail to provide what is needed I try reasonable steps, requesting whatever it was, then leave the matter and go concentrate on something else.  Not ideal, not good for the overall project,  but better for me. I've no idea what therapy or meds you have been given, I've had a huge range over the years and have found nowadays talk therapy with my psychiatrist gives me more perspective and reduces the importance of some things to the level where I can see the harm to me in continuing is greater than the good I can do.  Not being able to deal with mess is hard -on everyone. I personally think this is significant (I'm no doctor mind you) as I was that way, now I'm not.  Do you think a different approach from medical support perhaps not dealing so much with the ex-service matters, might be worth investigating?

I am sorry to hear that you are struggling with the issues you have described.  Sophie has replied to you and there has been some advise offered to your personally but I wanted to check in and see where you were at with it all and if you have been able to find yourself above water in terms of your work and your relationship in any way?  These are two really big things and to both have difficulties occurring at once must be so tough for you.  The sensation of needing structure, competence, cleanliness, order, contribution - in a world that is so 'out of order', would be very frustrating. Most of the suggestions I have to offer would involve what you stated hasn't worked for you, ie. counselling and a visit to your GP or health professional.  I wonder if you have tried seeing a different therapist and getting a second opinion as sometimes it can take a few tries to get the right fit.  There are many people on the forum who have seen several different counsellors and psychologists with not very great results and then they meet the right one....and it makes all the difference.  One thing you haven't mentioned is Mindfulness.  I wonder if you have tried to learn this technique in the past?  It is challenging to become really good at it, but it is something that teaches you to let go or give up control over some of things you can't. It also allows your mind to have a rest which some of us aren't very good at doing. It might be another option to try.  There are Mindfulness courses around some areas but an introductory site is called Smiling Mind. https://www.smilingmind.com.au  There is a thread on the forum called ' Mindfulness: What Is It? (Even if you dont know please post so we can help grow the forums accordingly)" You can find it above using the search bar.  Sometimes persistence is key in finding the right strategy that works for you.  There are so many ways to heal out there.  If you feel comfortable, I hope you continue to post here on the forum as it is a safe place where you can vent and let go of some of those feelings.  You are not alone.  We are listening and I hope to hear how you are going.  Wishing you the best possible outcome,  Nures Jenn      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           blondguy  Life Member                 9321 posts        2 December 2019

Upon discharge I found civilian life almost traumatic as I tried to blend with workmates that simply didn’t have the same work ethic nor teamwork. Everyone for themselves.  I went on to work as a warder then local laws and many professions but I only truly settled in a workplace working alone in private investigations making my own decisions alone.  The ADF is a lifestyle, once removed it is alien in civvy street. Friends go their own way, objectives are less important.  Time is a healer, but you’ve had a lot of time. Medication takes weeks to take effect then appropriate dosage will be sort after. So it is a rocky road but worth the endurance.  counseling is important as that allows your partner to identify with the world you were programmed in.  The thing I identify with is the stress,like when you “hate how Australia has become”. I had to get therapy to be more realistic with my thoughts and ease worrying. Part of that process was to get distractions like hobbies and sports. If you can find one that your partner likes it’s a bonus eg we like caravanning and we both built our own. An exercise in teamwork.

I am so very beyond sorry that this is your daily fight, that the only relief you get is when you are asleep, my heart breaks for you.  You will be supported here and cared for , we see you and we hear how tired and over the whole damn thing you are, but I also hear the tiniest voice of strength, you are still fighting and you continue to fight each day, and show up to life, when it could be very easy I suppose not to.  You are so very brave and courageous to keep on doing each day when you feel so bloody lousy, that is brave.  I am wondering if you have some family that you live with, if you want to share that is. Is there anybody at all that you could reach out to, to chat, to just sit with you?  Are you seeing a medical professional for the depression and your anxiety?  They can really help not only with medications but with connections in the community for social groups that perhaps people with similar disorders to you can meet and at least have some social interaction, even though I hear you are so very shy and this probably sounds very overwhelming to you.  You don't have to be alone.  Sophie has given you some information and I am praying that you use these tools to reach out at this time when you are so very tired.  I hope to chat to you some more Bren23, I am so sorry that this lonliness is consuming you and that it seems to have caused a brick wall for you to meet a person to have a relationship with, and sexual experiences with , which I can hear that you want so very much.  I know you will think me silly for saying this but it is possible, possible to meet someone and to make the connections and have these interactions that you want, but it does take time and perhaps some therapy to break through some of the social anxiety walls that exists.

                                    in reply to Bren23     Hi Bren,  Take a step back and look at your life. If you are lonely, does your loneliness have to be filled in with a person, or could your void be filled by family, or even by getting a pet that can at least accompany you at home? These are temporary remedies, and at some point you would probably be better off seeing a GP or a therapist.    I should be listening to the advice I’m giving you, and I wish it was easy to just make all my problems go away, but life is tough, isn’t it?  You know, you’re young and you still have so much in life to live for. With regards to your social anxiety disorder, I once read a book that helped me get over it (at least 90% of the time!). I used to care so much about what people think that I clam up at times even when in my head I just want to express my thoughts. I hated meetings in workspaces, and would be terrified at even just the thought of public speaking. But what was written in the book made so much sense to me. To summarise, we worry so much about what people think of us when in reality, people mostly think about themselves and their life. Even if something really embarrassing happened, they’ll talk about it once or twice and forget afterwards. It’s the same with any controversial news. It comes up and it becomes forgotten as soon as the next thing comes.    Anyway, stay strong and don’t give up hope. I’m still trying to hold on as much as I can even when at times I feel like giving up, and you have so much more to live for than I do.

Topic: How do I regain trust for my cheating partner?   4 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        s12345     2 posts        28 November 2019    I have been with my partner for 3 years & we have a 2 year old child together. I love him dearly however I do not trust him at all. When our child was only 5 months old I found my partner cheating ( using online dating sites) I attempted to leave him however he threatened to end his life if I left. We spoke in length about what he had done and he seemed very remorseful, promising it wouldn't happen again. He admitted he is addicted to online dating and says he doesn't feel like its cheating. Because we had a baby together i decided to stay & try to work on our relationship. In the year following i caught him cheating again on online dating sites - another 2 times! Each time I have confronted him he denies it until i show him the proof and he becomes defensive and angry toward me. I have attempted to leave him on each occasion however he keeps threatening to take his life if i do. I feel a tremendous sense of quilt & couldn't forgive myself if he did harm himself, so i don't leave. For the past 2 years I have experienced extreme anxiety daily thinking he is continuing to lie to me and he is still cheating. I have become unable to function properly on a daily basis, my mental and physical health have been affected by his dishonesty. After the last episode he did seek professional help seeing a physiologist and is now on medication. However i do not know if it is helping or he is just becoming smarter at hiding his infidelity. I love my partner dearly, he is a wonderful father and a kind sole. We get along well and don't argue a lot ( the occasional disagreement like any other couple) but everyday I have a hovering cloud of doubt and it hurts that I can not trust him. Is it possible to rebuild the trust ?         Mark this post as helpful           s12345     2 posts        28 November 2019

                                    in reply to s12345     Hi s12345  Welcome to the BB forum, I am so glad that you have reached out for some support here, this is certainly a lot to manage and I am not sure if what I am going to say is going to be what you want to hear.  I am so sorry he is using his life as threats for you to stay, this is really unfair, so scary and very hurtful.  It actually shows you no respect at all, if he truly felt that you leaving was worth taking his life for then I am not sure how he can keep "cheating" on you.  I understand that the online thing is very easy, it is accessible and he can get some sort of quick thrill without too much fuss, and without you knowing.  Can I ask if you have asked him what he feels he is not getting from the relationship with you that he feels that he needs to get validation from women online?  I hear you say that he is getting some professional help and I think that is wonderful, he has some work to do to get his mental health in check and this is outside of the fact whether he is with you or not in a relationship.  It is so wonderful he is a great dad and that he has a kind soul, however trust is key in any relationship.  I am not able to answer your question as to if it is possible to rebuild trust with him, anything is possible if he is willing to do the work to show you he is trust worthy, not just tell you.  Trust your gut though, I really believe gut feelings know.  I think you need some time away perhaps for him to get his life sorted and to get his mental health in check and then see if he has the capacity to earn and rebuild your trust.  Your child deserves a happy mother and if you are living in fear of him taking his life, which actually is so very unfair and cruel as the only person responsible for his life is him, the threats he is making to you is terrible, and you are living in worry of him cheating this is not the best version of you for you or for your child.  I am not sure that I have helped today and I hope that you can reach out perhaps to your doctor too if you need some extra support at this time and this is so very stressful for you.  I am so sorry you are feeling like this and this pressure is being put on you.

                                    in reply to s12345     Hi S12345,  Rebuilding trust is a very hard thing to do, but definitely not impossible if you're both willing to invest the time and effort (especially him).  I really am sorry to hear that you feel anxious all the time and unhappy about what you're going through as I've been down that road as well. I think you should ask yourself the question of what is best for you? What would make you happy? Because your happiness extends to your child as well, and no matter how brave a face you put on, children are very perceptive and will notice over time, especially as they get older.  My experience might not apply to your situation as I can't really see into your life, but I stayed with my ex-partner for 10 years because I wanted my daughter to grow up in a family that was not broken. I found out after I gave birth that he was visiting dating sites, and when we moved places I found out he was cheating on me with a co-worker. Living with the knowledge for 10 years that he's cheated on me constantly made me paranoid and very unhappy. Every time his phone chimed I'd be wondering if he was cheating on me. Thinking back on it now, I wish I left him very early on and saved myself years of hurt and unhappiness. I'm not saying you should do that, but you should seriously think about yourself and your happiness.  If there is one thing I have realised over the years, and talking to people who have experience the same as me, is that once someone crosses that bridge, it's not hard for them to do so again.I hope that for you it turns out very differently as it did for me.

There are a few points that i want to make here and the first is that THE ONLY person responsible for your boyfriend's life is HIM.  If he cannot afford you the time to take care of your mental health then he is most certainly not supporting you or your efforts to get well.  If he loved you that much that he would take his life if you left, why would he not afford you the time to take a break and get well, that just does not make sense and it is totally cruel and hurtful.  Yes you do feel like you are trapped and I feel like this is the point of his threat, so you will not leave him, but what sort of a loving relationship can be had when one person feels trapped and so unhappy and is having mental health concerns.  You said you have been arguing everyday and feeling disconnected, I feel like this is most certainly time for you to take some time for yourself and to get well.  I know it will be very scary as you obviously have strong feelings for him, however if he does feel like he is suicidal he needs to take some steps to look after himself.  If you feel like you want to give him some contacts like Lifeline on 13 11 14 or even tell him to call an ambulance if he is in danger you could do that but you are not in any way responsible for his life, for anyone's life..just your own, and you have every right to leave a relationship if it no longer makes you feel good about yourself.  You have a long life ahead of you and so many things to look forward to, please take this time to look after you.  The people at kids Helpline deal with young people up to the age of 25 and they are so very supportive and wonderful and perhaps you could give them a call for some support here.  Can I ask if you have some family that you can lean on to support you through this time? Do you live with your boyfriend?  Him saying that you never loved him is also very hurtful and I am so sorry you are going through this time.  It is so very hard and I hope that you come back to chat some more here, we are here for you.

It was so brave of you..well done.  I know that you are feeling so very scared and so responsible for what happens to him, it is such a very horrible thing and a very awful threat that he has placed on you, but keep talking here and call the Helpline anytime, just to chat or to get some assistance, whatever you need.  I do understand that you don't want to cause unnecessary friction between your grandparents and your boyfriend but they too will want to help and protect you and I think letting them know some of the picture might be helpful so you have some support at home.  I don't want to make a judgement, but I have just recently lost my 19 year old brother to suicide and my grandmother is really struggling with the concept and the notion of what he "did"..there is a bit of a generational gap in the understanding of suicide and it really is only recently, not perhaps their generation, that we are talking about suicide and giving it the open forum it needs.  What i am getting at is perhaps with the suicide threats you could talk that through here, or on the Helplines, I just am not sure my grandmother would be very supportive to me or the situation, not because she doesn't care, she just doesn't understand..she has said some really awkward things but not through being mean, just because she doesn't understand. I mean no offence when I say this and I am not sure how old your grandparents are, mine is almost 90!  I am so sorry you have to go through this and I am so happy to support you through this time.

Topic: Feelings of Hopelessness   4 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        Tanop     3 posts        30 November 2019    As I get older, my feelings of loneliness and depression are morphing into feelings of utter hopelessness.  I find myself getting angry. Feeling of "It's not fair", "why me", "If i could just have 1 more chance to do things right"  When i get in these moods I tend to break things around my house, and hurt myself.  I can't find happiness or comfort in anything. I don't eat, I don't play games or watch movies, I don't sleep. I often sit there tormenting myself with my mistakes and shortcomings. I drives my utterly insane.  It's as if I can feel no way out of this hole. As if, no matter how hard I try, or how great my life becomes in the future, nothing will make up for all the years I've lost and all the childhood memories I never had. When people reminisce on the 'good times' I feel like I'll never be able to do that.  It pains me to constantly see the people i consider my friends constantly going out to parties, getting drinks, having fun, and NEVER inviting or even considering me. This turns into a vicious cycle, as my jealousy makes me push them further out of my life, resulting in them being less likely into consider me.  I really have tried to forge relationships. I always introduce myself to new people, and I try to always stay positive around the people i know in the hopes that they will start to enjoy my company. But non of these relationships seems to stick. Non of turn into anything meaningful. I even recently swallowed my gut and messaged on old school female friend. I really tried to be interested in her life, but it went terribly, and just ended up making me feel worse.  I just don't know what to do.      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Soberlicious96  Community Champion                 348 posts        30 November 2019

                                    in reply to Tanop     Dear Tanop,  Welcome to Beyond Blue and well done for reaching out.  I am sorry to hear that you are not feeling as happy as you would like to be. Life can seem quite bleak when things are not as we would like them to be. I would also like to suggest, at this point, that if you ever feel like you are getting so angry or upset that you might hurt yourself, please consider picking up the phone to call an ambulance or lifeline on 131114, rather than picking things to break or harm yourself.  Have you thought about talking to your doctor and/or a counselor about what is going on for you? There may be an underlying health issue, which your doctor could help out with, or maybe a counselor could help you to sort some things out as well?  You mentioned that " nothing will make up for all the years I've lost and all the childhood memories I never had " which also makes me wonder about your age? Not that you have to specify that, of course, you don't have to tell me that! But when I started reading your post, and as I read through, I found myself wondering; is this person in their twenties, or in their fifties?  I also noticed that you have tried many things in order to make connections, and yet you still feel as though it's just not really happening, yeah? Well, sometimes a hobby can be a great distraction from the myriad of 'peopley' type of things that we have to try and navigate each and every day. Perhaps, if you don't have a hobby, that is something you could pursue, and who knows where that could take you?!  Anyway,  don't know if that helps or not, but I do hope it does. At least a little.  In the meantime, you can post here, and/or reply to this thread as much as you like.  Take care. I'll be thinking of you. xo      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Tanop     3 posts        1 December 2019

                                    in reply to Soberlicious96     I really appreciate your response.  I'm in my 20s. I know that's still young, but I can't help but feel that I've ruined the foundation of my life.  I've never gone to a doctor or counselor about my problems before. I don't think I would be comfortable doing that. Also, I don't think I have any underlying health issues. I suppose it's possible, but i feel like anyone would feel the same way as me if they were in my situation.  Also, yes I do have a hobby, I've spent a great deal of time in my life pursuing art. It certainly can be a distraction at times, and is probably the reason I've made it this far. However, I feel that it has probably done more harm than good. I've managed to make a very meager amount of money off commissioning my art, allowing me to quit my part time job while I study at uni. Which was great at first, but has meant that i sometimes spend many days in a row, sitting in doors, not talking to anyone, which can often feel like torture. During those times I usually go to the supermarket just to sit in a public space for a while. I sometimes I just sit there, staring into space, dreading going back home.

                                    in reply to Tanop     Hi there. My ex used to say "it's never too late to start again" and I kinda like that because sometimes I look back at the mess I've made and feel sad. Loneliness is a dreadful thing so I'm sorry you're experiencing this. I'm in my 40's and on my own since my ex left and my son moved out a few years ago. I like to take advantage of things going on in the community where I can be a part of things without needing someone to be with me. I've taken up free yoga on Saturdays, there's a free art tour coming up, if there's a food truck festival or markets on I'll go to that. All offer a chance to be around people and maybe have a small conversation. They offer a reprieve from the loneliness even if for a bit. I'm wondering if there are events or groups at uni you might like to join? Perhaps there is a way to connect with other artists? Making friends is difficult at any age, but please don't give up.      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful            Close

Topic: No real friends   4 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        Jeffrey545     1 posts        30 November 2019    Recently I've been feeling really isolated. I feel like no one REALLY cares about me. Basically, my small group of 4ish friends for like 2 years kinda spread apart and everyone has been able to find new people to be friends with. Except me. Since I've not been hanging out with them I have felt incredibly lonely and I've tried to find a new group of friends like the others but I have found it incredibly difficult. I have tried to join the group that my two of my friends went to but i cant quite crack it and I don't like many of them anyway. I have people who I kind of hang around but I don't know if they even know I am there and I am never invited by them, or in that case anyone, to meet outside of school. I still have friends but none of them are really close with one another so I don't have a group of people to do things with at best I have one at a time and whenever i do see them i feel like I'm boring them.  Because of this and as it's my last year of school I am terrified of what will happen after school finishes if i have no one and I'll just be at home alone for god knows how long. This thought to me makes me feel utterly helpless along with the fact i feel like i am missing so many good times as I have no one to do anything with, instead I spend my weekends alone playing video games and watching movies.  This is also hard as I see that my mum has realised this, given that I used to go out and see my small friend group basically every weekend for almost 6 months then it suddenly stopped, and since I have been out with friends only a handful of times.  This is the slightly dark part. All of this together the feeling of disappointing and humiliating myself by having no friends to my mum, peers at school and to myself makes me sometimes feel as if suicide would be the easy option. It makes me feel like a coward just writing that and I don't see myself doing this in the near future, but some days I feel like I get very close to following through and I am worried.

Please know that you’re not alone in this and that our community is here to work through this difficult time with you.  As you’ve mentioned that you’ve been struggling with thoughts of suicide, we are contacting you through email with some additional support.

                                    in reply to Jeffrey545     Hi Jeffrey545,  Along with Sophie, let me welcome you here. To write down what you are going through and feeling takes courage and is a brave act. People that I have spoken to about my own battles tell me how brave I am for fighting and getting help. In a way, your coming here is a way of getting help?  You said that you are at school so I wonder if you might be able to have a chat with the school counsellor?  For me, not opening up about what I was going through was the worst thing I could have done - keeping the pain inside was not helpful. And that you are having suicidal thoughts also shows the seriousness of the situation. You said your mum might realise what is happening and waiting for you to chat with her? Would you be able to tell her how you are feeling?  You can find more information here - https://kidshelpline.com.au/teens/issues/im-thinking-about-suicide  School and friendships can be difficult. As we get older the things we like and dislike change - kids who might have been our friends before primary school will develop their own likes etc. And at the moment it sounds like you do not really feel part of the groups you hang out with at school. Perhaps you might tell me some of the things you like? Things you like to do? Do those you chat to at school have similar likes?  Most importantly, I want you to know that I am listening.... I hope you will come back and chat some more.  Tim         Mark this post as helpful           Katyonthehamsterwheel     94 posts        30 November 2019

Good on your for posting here :) I just want to reply as a mum to a son who had a similar experience as you when he was at school, and say that I was absolutely not disappointed at all in him (in case you think your mum thinks that).

        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        Erin83     2 posts        24 November 2019    Hi  I had my 2nd suicide attempt 3 weeks ago and have been home for a week. This was by far my worst one, I was in ICU in a coma and the doctors told my family to come and say goodbye and even if I did wake up I may have brain damage (thankfully I don’t)  My best friend had been so supportive but now she won’t speak to me. She said she is angry and said that she can’t live her life constantly worrying when I will do it again so she has cut me out of her life. We had been friends for 15 years. I was always there for her and until now she had always been there for me. I don’t have any other friends and my family is a source of conflict for me. I am struggling so much with the thoughts of just ending it all but I don’t want another failed attempt. I have some outside supports in place who have been amazing but it’s not the same.  My depression started with the loss of my dad last year and my mum blamed me because she was babysitting for me and my dad was home alone. He was fit and healthy so there was no reason for any concern with him being on his own. He had a massive stroke and died a week later.  My mum and I had moved past her comments or so I thought but when his anniversary came around a few weeks ago it was said again and my world crumbled around me.  Everyday feels like Groundhog Day at the moment, I’m exhausted and defeated. I’m angry that I survived yet I feel such enormous guilt.  My ex partner is using my depression to try and get full custody of my daughter because I’m an unfit mother in his eyes. My daughter is 12 and sees her dad every second weekend. The chances of him getting custody are slim as he has 2 assault convictions against our daughter but it doesn’t stop me feeling like it’s possible.  I feel like a failure and like I’m not doing enough to get better and that I should just put on my big girl pants and get on with it but it’s just so damn draining! I know that everyone says things will get better but lately if just feels like I’m being kicked while I’m down over and over.

                                    in reply to Erin83     Hi Erin83  I'm so sorry to hear you are experiencing pain so unbearable that you can't live with it. It is a truly torturous feeling, to be contemplating life and self worth in such a way. I can relate to what this sort of pain is like.  I am left to wonder who has been raising you since your dad passed. I know this may sound a bit strange but I believe it's worth some consideration, in order to understand just how low we can fall at times. It is said that we raise children but I believe we're supposed to raise each other, no matter our age. We can experience comments that lower us, such as the cruel comment your mum made whilst she was in pain. We can experience comments that ground us, such as 'It'll be okay. Don't worry. I'm here for you'. How often do we hear the comments that raise us in ways far above basic grounding?  Imagine being raised throughout your life to believe that when someone passes you can still experience them. So once they did pass, you could feel comfort in knowing they are there with you in some way. You could chat with them (might feel like a one way conversation). If you felt one of those weird cold chills folk sometimes get, you could imagine this person was saying 'Hi, I'm here'. I know this sounds really really weird but imagine instead of feeling the pain from your mum's comments, you felt your dad saying 'I'm here and I need you to comfort your mum for me'. I know this way of thinking is not everyone's thing but it's the kind of thing that has the ability to raise some people out of intense grief and guilt.  You've faced much that has lowered you/brought you down: Your dad's passing, your mum's comment, your friend not understanding the true challenge she faces in raising you, your ex regarding custody and so on. I believe the greatest challenge we face in life is in raising our self when where not exactly sure how to do this.  I believe your friend perhaps finds the relationship to be one of heartbreaking challenge. A broken heart is a hard thing to deal with. Do you think if you spoke to her and acknowledged her heartbreak (the possibility of losing you), she would listen. Do you believe that you could guide her through the challenges you both face with the depression you're in? Do you believe the relationship could change if you offered the idea of raising each other through this? You have both faced incredible overwhelming challenge through this experience. Take care of each other.  Sending loving thoughts your way :)      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Nahmate830     32 posts        26 November 2019

                                    in reply to Erin83     Hi Erin,  I'm so sorry for everything that you have gone through, I hope that you know that with regards to your Ex that the law is very much on the side of the main care giver, being you, and that it would take extraordinary circumstances for them to award custody to someone else and its unlikely to be a person who has twice been convicted of assaulting the child in question, I'm surprised that he would even have unsupervised access at all.  With regards to your mother she is obviously sad and angry and although she outwardly blames you she most likely inwardly blames herself and lashes out because of her sadness and guilt. This is a terribly tragic event where there should be no blame, not on you, not on your mother, not on anyone. People die, loved ones die and there is nothing any of us can do to stop it.  It is devastating visiting a loved one in a coma, even when they have been unwell you still feel so helpless and this can lead to frustration and anger over the lack of control over the situation. I have personally received one of those calls to come say goodbye and its heart wrenching and it hurts. I'm sure for your friend that they are still processing all of that hurt sadness and frustrating and that in time you will be able to repair the friendship, it will probably take some time though.  I encourage you to read Sophie M's message again and write down the numbers so that if you are feeling vulnerable again that you have available the numbers to call should you need them and I also strongly encourage you to call 000 if you don't feel you can control yourself.  I hope that the hospital has set you up with some professionals who can help you with everything that is going on and that your are practicing good self care.  sending much love your way.

This week has been tough, really tough I’m not going to lie. So many times I have considered just ending it all. I reached out to my support person and let her know just how bad thing were and also to my GP earlier in the week and this weekend is the hardest because my daughter Is with her dad and it is also my best friends birthday today. So today my GP wanted a follow up just to check in or so I thought because when I got there he was very concerned and decided that I needed to be scheduled. I had no say and was carted off in an ambulance to my nearest PECC. I felt like the appointment was a set up and I was ambushed, I was extremely upset and frustrated.  When I got there I had a chat to the Psych and he was also quite concerned however I managed to convince him that I was safe to go home. It is something that I am very good at hiding how I really feel and lying to myself and everyone around me about how I truely feel.  Now that I am home I realise that their concern was justified and I am stupid to fight against the treatment that I desperately need. I have decided that in the morning I am going to admit myself voluntarily. It was stubbornness and anger at my GP for doing what needed to be done that made me lie, it was my illness talking if that makes sense. I am done letting this illness speak for me and convince everyone I am ok when really I am not! I wanted to be in control of the situation and I’ve come to realise that this is one situation where I need to let my guard down and accept the help that is being offered.  sorry I am rambling a bit but I truely hope that I still feel this way in the morning and that the next time I post it will be that I have been released and am doing so much better 🤞🤞  Depression Sucks!!      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           smallwolf  Community Champion                 3063 posts        29 November 2019

                                    in reply to Erin83     Hi Erin,  Not trying to be funny here, but I think because we live with ourselves each day we know how we process things and think everything is normal. Those outside of us may see a different picture, whether that relates to positive changes or feeling worse. My psychologist and psychiatrist see positive changes in me, yet I do not see it like them. In your post you mentioned their concern was justified - things are easier to see in hindsight. I know you said that tomorrow you were going to admit yourself. And in the meantime, don't be hard on yourself.  It is also OK to ramble if it helps to get those thoughts out of your head! Believe me, I do it each day in one way or another.

                                    in reply to Erin83     Hi Erin83  As Tim mentioned, don't be so hard on yourself . It's hard to deny that depression feels like an emotional marathon at times. It's exhausting both mentally and physically. Without a doubt, it's incredibly draining. Then suddenly when another part of the challenge pops up, like running up some psychological hill, there's that thought 'I don't think I can make it'.  Asking people to jump in from the sidelines can sometimes make some difference. You want to sort of curse them for their energy and enthusiasm and for not knowing how exhausting the emotional marathon has become but sometimes it's about letting them get you through, letting them support you and inspire you to get up that hill.  Erin, you are a truly exhausted champion. Your endurance in incredible. Your commitment to running life's race, facing the toughest parts of the journey and powering through, is to be deeply admired. I believe it's the journey up that hill and out of the depression which is the most overwhelming part of all. For those who have made it up and then look back at what they've achieved, there is no feeling in life like it. For myself, I think of that hill, I think of that struggle (that took me 15 years to complete) and I still to this very day think 'I can't believe I survived that'. I am far more powerful than I ever believed.  Again, you are an exhausted champion Erin. You are far more powerful than what you've come to believe. Sounds a bit strange perhaps but if you were to imagine that this is the toughest and most challenging and demanding part of the (human) race, would you climb that hill out of the depression with a different mindset? Would you meet the challenge differently knowing that in having met it and reached the winning line at the top, you could see yourself as the champion that you are? Is it possible to finally stop running the race and just live without so many conditions imposed by the human race? By the way, you can grit your teeth, roll your eyes, cry, scream, sigh and so on as much as you want whilst you're doing it all. Whatever gets you through.  It takes one to know one; I see the champion in you. I see the uphill battle. With heartfelt love and faith in you, I cheer you on with every ounce of my being.

The beyondblue helpline is: 1300 22 4636  I wonder if you can talk to your support people and tell them you need more help? If you have a browse around the forums you'll also find strategies that other people use that you might find helpful too. I find yoga and meditation helpful, but maybe writing in a journal or finding hobbies that you like might help you.

        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        ess_love     2 posts        9 October 2019    So alot has happened & it's difficult to make sense of everything.  I was in a toxic work environment for 3 years & sought counselling to deal & be able to turn up (when I turned up at my 3rd session, I met 2 of my equivalents from diff departments also attending - ikr. Sigh. Not a good place to work at)  I moved with my partner to a new state, in part running away from this job but it gave us the opp. to buy a house, I started a PhD, & had a falling out with 2 of my oldest friends. I think I'm a terrible person+friend now.  My mother passed away, unfortunately, it was a very difficult passing.  My supervisors were made redundant at uni & the temporary supervisor I got was gaslighting me. Hard. I sought support from uni but because of all the budget cuts & their own political problems it all turned to shit. (A bunch of students left, put in formal complaints etc. I was encouraged to but didn't..I still have to see her in industry circles).  My sister's husband passed away suddenly & I looked after her kids for a few month while she went overseas to wrap up all their affairs (she is having it tough - and she is absolutely amazing...) but it meant I took a few months away from my work & uni & the work I do dried up. It meant that I'm not prepared for this year.  So now, I've quit the PhD, my work has dried up, I'm trying to get more work & applying for things, I can't get unemployment benefits, I have endometriosis (argh - yes, I wish the list didn't go into health) & I'm having trouble getting out of bed.  As part of my work, I apply for grants, federal funding etc whilst applying for jobs too, so constantly working for free getting projects together but also that means constantly dealing with rejection. I've never been unemployed for so long.  I feel so backed into a corner, so tired, with plummeting confidence & suddenly this amazing ability to cry at the drop of hat. Or it could be from my endo & my hormones being out of whack. A few weeks ago I tried to end it - but it didn't work. My partner found me. We had had a big fight & I just didn't want to be here when he got home. But I worried about how he would find me & what he would do with our little puppy. Anyway, a big part of that was the new meds I was on-got rid of those.  But still struggling. No more thoughts of suicide-I really think that was the change in meds. I just think my resilience is gone. I'm full of self doubt, vulnerable & -$. A hot layered mess.

                                    in reply to ess_love     hello and welcome to beyond blue.  it sounds like to you have been through a lot, and had to deal with a lot.  You said your post was a rant. I wonder how you felt after you wrote it and hit the post button?  the interesting thing about your post was the lack of any questions.  despite everything you have been through, you are still able to get up the apply for grants etc. - there is an inner strength in you. There were some other positives in your post that show kindness in you.  Do you still get professional help?  this forum is full of supportive people. I hope that you might feel safe enough to tell more of your story here. And perhaps together you will find that better place.  Peace and comforting thoughts you,  tim        1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           sparrowhawk     154 posts        10 October 2019

                                    in reply to ess_love     Hi there, welcome.  First, I am sorry you have been through so much.  It is great you were able to leave the toxic work situation and seek help. It is very, very draining to endure such toxicity over an extended period of time. It does take a lot of strength to make changes.  Are you able to share more about the situation with your friends? Why does that make you feel like a terrible person or friend? It does sound like you are motivated, judging by your move and academic work. That's a big asset and achievement.  The situation with your supervisor sounds like it probably just added to the previous toxicity you'd experienced at work. Having to see the person who has hurt you is very, very difficult. Do you have ways to cope when you need to interact with her?  I agree with Tim, what you shared indicates you have kindness and concern for others. This is a safe space.      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           ess_love     2 posts        29 November 2019    Thank you Tim and Sparrowhawk for responding. I'm still struggling, I'm on a waitlist to see a psychologist as part of my wholistic care from my Endo.  I guess I feel like a terrible person because being left behind by my friend makes me feel like I did something wrong and even though I asked her if there was something I did wrong, she never replied, and then that made me think I'm not worth even responding to...Felt really painful, not hearing from her or her just cutting me out of her life like that after having been friends for over 20 years. Which then made me think, I must be terrible if someone who knows me so well does such a thing...And I don't know if our mutual friends got told, but they all drifted away too. It must be me. I guess I just need to work at getting over it but its difficult to rebuild my self esteem. The whole supervisor thing is so hard, I feel like I'm being professionally ostracised..In fact, I feel like the town I live in is so small that I've been black listed. Writing that feels like it is a similar issue to the friends situation, maybe I'm just paranoid and I'm not learning from my mistakes. I wish I could figure out my mistakes. I know my weaknesses but I can't see that I made mistakes in these relationships. How to let go....? Going round round in circles           Mark this post as helpful            Close

        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        Wandering Soul     10 posts        28 November 2019    After a long period of unemployment, I found some temporary work with an organisation that I used to work for, many years ago.  My time with this organisation previously was a pleasant one. I had a great manager and everyone was helpful and friendly.  This time round, other than the furniture, everything changed, including the company name. The former manager had retired and the staff are all different from the ones I knew before. Too many organisation restructuring.  The environment now appeared more politically charged and the people are selfish and keep to themselves.  I was doing work and earning praise from the management.  I worked hard because I want to feel confident about myself again and I hope a good reference will lead to longer term work.  What I did not realise was jealous staff who set me up to do a difficult task and conspire to make me fail and backstab me.  It was too late, because I had not known the political game they are playing.  My contract is not extended and I am finishing up in a few days. I fell sick. I have suicidal thoughts.  My GP put me on a MHCP for next year. I tried calling Lifeline was put on hold for more than 20 mins.  I wonder why we cannot stop people who create mental health issues on others to protect their jobs.  We have people who do stupid things that create problems for others. And we stop solving problems.  Has Australia becomes a place where things don't get fixed.  Maybe I should just resign from this living world myself because I do not want to be a part of horrible world. I would only find peace in death. Like in RIP.

                                    in reply to Sophie_M     Dear Sophie_M,  Managed to get to Lifeline. It was helpful to have a chat but I did pity the counsellor who had to listen to my situation. Hope she is alright. I was in distress that my voice was cracking up and I ended the call with the feeling that I am listened to.  She did think that "Rest In Peace" is not a advertisement for Suicide. :)  And I believe our society need to have a conversation on how to get along better with each other, so that we can "Live In Peace" and don't make suicide an option.  I always hear about workplace safety to stop preventable death.  Perhaps we need to create non toxic workplaces to prevent mental health issues and suicides.  If only we can fix unemployment, esp underemployment.         Mark this post as helpful           white knight  Community Champion                 6808 posts        28 November 2019

                                    in reply to Sophie_M     Hi WS, welcome again  This is a very common problem of which I have much personal experience.  Short story- 1987, age 31yo I was a local laws officer and had pressure placed upon me to give preferential treatment to a state politician. I refused. Eventually arguing with my boss I had chest pains. Diagnosis heart attack. Off work. 3 months later told I didnt have a heart attack but a panic attack. Remained off work. 12 months later I found another job after I was officially sacked.  What I learned out of that terrible experience is the world, meaning workplaces are not immuned to cruel acts, bullying, politics and nastiness. That in such bad environment we should not be afraid nor dishonoured by resigning and seeking work elsewhere. Fighting the inground system is fraught with danger.

        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        timidpea     3 posts        27 November 2019    So, I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ASD. I feel like i have no support, zero. Everyone who is nice and actually treats me right has a life of their own and are not in arms reach. I can't possibly begin to describe how lonely i feel, i've been feeling like this consistently for 10 years with few breaks. The reason i posted this in the PTSD category is because when i was ten, i had a bad accident involving a pet that included threats, screaming and pretty much experiencing a full blown mental breakdown, i never cried like i did that day. Since then i can't see or hear any media correlating to the incident specifically to cats getting hurt. (Which for some reason horror movies love hurting cats) If I do get 'triggered' i experience extreme nausea, intrusive thoughts/flashbacks and mental instability. I'm also suspicious in regarding if i'm traumatised from my mum's parenting? I remember her screaming at me at the top of her lungs when i was 7. She told me i was selfish when i confessed my suicidal thoughts to her at 10. She treats me badly nowadays. I can't stand small children due to the blatant favouritism because they're small and controllable. She's very passive aggressive and easily gets set off. Worst part is that she has good side and i know she loves me but she makes me want to kill myself. I can't begin to tell you how much i envy kids with good parental relationships, my mum barely acknowledges me in the room anymore and all we talk about is her complaining or being negative about something. It's like living with an angry ghost. I feel terrible at how little progress i'm doing; i believe i have executive dysfunction considering that's a common ASD symptom. I have no job, my school's kicked me out because i'm 18, my therapist is barely there, my families barely there, i haven't had a close friend since grade 3 and Christmas nearly drives me to suicide every year. I'm barely hanging onto the hope there's a better future because i'm the only one thats going to get myself there and i don't think i have enough strength...please help, i feel so weak and pathetic and lonely.

It makes me very anxious, worried and feeling like I need to be here for him 24/7 incase something goes wrong but I can feel myself getting beaten down and back pedalling on my healing journey.  He has booked in with a therapist but can only get an app in a couple of months so I feel obligated to be the one he goes to first when he is feeling helpless and in a crisis, I’ve told him that I’m there for him but I can’t be all the time which he understands but it does play on my mind if I’m not around when he is really down and I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if something were to happen when I need space.  How do I be there for him from a distance when he is so reliant on me making him feel grounded?

                                    in reply to bellaupia     Hi bellaupia  I am so glad that you have reached out for some support and
I can hear how worried and scared you are for your ex partner, also seeing that
you mentioned you are struggling with your mental health too. The thing is, you are not his carer and as hard as that is
you cannot be with him 24/7 and nor should there be the expectation that you
can be.  You too have to live your life
and with peace.  This might be really
hard to hear but you cannot prevent a decision that your ex partner makes to
end his life or to stay in this life, I know that is a horrible thought but the
choice is ultimately his.  What you can do is provide him with
some numbers to call, first and foremost if he is in danger now, an ambulance
on 000, if he feels he needs to talk to someone now there is Lifeline 13 11 14,
they are amazing and have some professional that can help him through this
time. There is also the wonderful people at the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300
659 467.  This is so much pressure on you as
I can hear how you are feeling responsible for his life and that is most
certainly not the case, you can support him through this time but if he wants
help he needs to reach out and take it, from a professional and to get some
support at this time.  That is a very big
load to carry, someone’s life and this is his load, not yours.  It is so wonderful of you to agree to help
him, even though you are no longer in a relationship, that is wonderful, but
you also need to take care of you too.  If you need some help you too can
reach out to Beyond Blue call line on 1300 22 4636, or even making an
appointment at your GP to get some help for you too, your sure sound like you
could use some support here.  Huge hugs to you bellaupia, we are here to chat and to listen and be here for you.  AS         Mark this post as helpful           bellaupia     5 posts        27 November 2019

I have such a huge spot in my heart for him and I don’t know why I can’t put myself first and I don’t know how. But I know I need to, we separated over 1.5 yrs ago due to an affair and i have moved on from it and grown from our co dependant relationship and am finally getting use to my life just being me and learning and growing everyday, but it seems like he has just woken up and come to terms with it all and all the decisions he has made, and I feel for him because I went through it from the start And he is just at the beginning so I feel like I can say and do the right things to help him get through it but I also know it’s not healthy and he needs to get help elsewhere but every time I suggest it, it doesn’t go down well.

                                    in reply to bellaupia     Hi bellaupia  I totally hear you it is such a difficult situation for you to be in.  I know it is hard but you must afford yourself the time to get well too and if you feel like you are not in the right head space you need to call that, this sort of caring for another can really take its toll, even more so if you are having troubles yourself.  When he responds with no one is there for him and he is alone, you can reinforce that this is not infact true and there are people on the other end of these lines who are their to support and care and give advice, for this very reason, when people need help and feel alone.  I hear that the guilt is overwhelming and you do have a soft spot for him in your heart, that is so caring of you but it really is not your role to "fix" him and be "on call".  He can have some of your time but not your undivided attention, that is simply too much for you, for anyone to have to manage.  That is so wonderful that you have moved on from the relationship, however can I suggest maybe not fully as he still has the emotional catch on you that drags you back to care for him.  Can I also say that usually the person with whom you have ended the relationship usually cannot be the person to heal you.  That he will truly not learn to stand on his own until you ask that of him.  I am by no means discounting how hard this will be, but for your mental health and to be fair, his, you must draw a line in the sand and explain to him that you cannot be this person in his healing.  I am sorry it doesn't go down well and that is sometimes a really hard thing to accept, but once he reaches out to a support network he will feel like he has someone to be there for him.  I am also hoping that once his therapist starts to see him this will help immensely too.  I do understand that is some time away yet, so I think the phone services are a good place for him to start.

                                    in reply to Aaronsis     Thank you Aaronsis  I know there is plenty of guilt from his affair and I know that this is not a healthy way for either of us to move forward. I don’t want to be in a relationship with him anymore I’m taking my time finding myself and growing but it does hurt that he is so lost and feels helpless, I don’t want him thinking everyone has given up on him but at the same time I need to look after myself, and some times when I break through to him and explain that this isn’t a healthy way to moving forward for either of us he sometimes see’s it too, I guess I just need to back away slowly until he seeks help with his therapist and see’s it for himself.

                                    in reply to bellaupia     Hey bellaupia  Try to be kind to you, I can hear how very hard this is for you and that you want to make the break but so very scared you will feel responsible for his choices.  I can hear how much you care for him and that is wonderful but as you said, you don't want to be in a relationship with him and as hard as it is you cannot be around to be at his call to support him during this time.  It is simply too  much to ask, of anyone really, all you can do it is give him the tools, being the numbers to call, I am not sure if he has family he can also lean on but this is not fair to you.  Can I suggest that even when he treatment starts the process to wellness may take some time, perhaps a long time and will he expect you to be there for that too?  You are entitled to live your life and without guilt, it is fine that he is showing remorse for his actions and that is great, however it really does not effect the situation today as you are not in a relationship with him, so great you feel sorry but you are trying to move on.

Topic: It's always something... This time it's work.   10 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        Innocuous     10 posts        11 November 2019    I have been dealing with chronic suicide ideation for about two years now. I have been working through it with good support from my partner and a psychologist and am staying safe.  Recently, I have lost my job (external circumstances). For about a month I have had no income despite looking for work consistently. Just last night, I was stressing about my financial situation and my inability to find a job. The stress of it, along with feelings of worthlessness and uselessness due to my inability to find work, brought on those familiar feelings. I realised that for the first time ever my financial situation was actually bringing on my suicidal thoughts. I guess capitalism finally broke me!  I'm still hopeful and looking for work (something that doesn't make me too anxious, hopefully). The job search is tough, especially since I am also a full-time university student. It feels weird that after so long working through all my personal problems, that work and money is now the biggest determinant of my wellbeing.  What advice do you all have for finding work/managing money with mental illness?

                                    in reply to Innocuous     Hi Innocuous,  welcome to beyond blue.  I will answer your questions first ... On finding work, have you considered volunteer work between looking for jobs. It might give you a sense of accomplishment. On managing money it comes down to sticking to a budget - and if you did a google search for "managing money with mental illness" you will find some excellent resources. Just stick to the government or mental heath web sites. There are also the groups like the Salvation Army who can give you free financial advice -  https://www.salvationarmy.org.au/need-help/financial-assistance/financial-counselling/  For you... I noticed that you have the support of your partner and psychologist. That is a very good start and you are being proactive about all of this. Do your parents know about what is happening to you at the moment?  I have also been seeing a psychologist for 2 years now (and psychiatrist) dealing with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. I do not think I have to give you any distraction or coping ideas as I am sure you would have enough of these from your psychologist. Except that daily I have to continue to look for the positives or do black dot on the paper exercise. I can listen to you,  Tim         Mark this post as helpful           Innocuous     10 posts        13 November 2019

                                    in reply to smallwolf     Hi Tim,  Volunteering sounds like a great idea in between work. I'll definitely keep an eye out for some nearby opportunities.  Managing my budget is difficult. I cut all unnecessary spending and make sure I buy cheap food options. I make things where possible. I have some savings so it really is just about getting income to cover rent before that runs out.  My parents know a little bit. I told them about the problems I was having and the steps I have been taking to work on it. Although, in typical parent fashion as soon as I started on treatment they assumed everything was magically better! They have given me some money which makes up the bulk of my savings so far which helps the financials, but it does mean I don't want to ask for any more help unless I'm desperate.  I'm trying to take it all in stride. I'm still applying for jobs. Hopefully I can manage to get something with enough regular hours that I can get back in the green soon. I don't like having to rely on people. I would hate to have to move out of my rental and back in with my parents.  Sounds like you've been on a bit of a journey too! It's been a while since I've seen my psych but I'm booked in for next week so I'm looking forward to that. In the meantime, I'm trying my best to do positive visualise. Imagining myself in a job and serving customers or whatever and feeling confident. It's definitely helping with the stress/anxiety aspect of the problem.  The suicide ideation was, thankfully, just a short thought. I'm back to my usual level of "I mean, it wouldn't be the worst thing".

                                    in reply to Innocuous     On volunteering... I know someone in my area that works with the RSPCA and they are always looking for help.  When I was much younger and going through Uni (away from home) I was given an allowance by my parents that covered food and rent and not much else - this was during the time when Australia had the recession it had to have.  You also sound like you have the tools to maintain positive, though if things do get you down, remember that you could talk to your parents? My situation is probably different to yours as my father suffers from anxiety and depression also, but in talking to my parents about my situation helped him, and mum would also have an opportunity to vent or chat. In short, they liked the contact. The bond or the relationship between the parent and child (me) deepened.  Good luck with your appointment next week. Let me know how it goes if you want.

                                    in reply to smallwolf     The RSPCA would be great. I love animals (who doesn't). But I don't drive so they are all a bit far away to get to. I'm pretty limited by my bike and bus routes.  Your parents sound like they a really awesome and helpful. My parents really do try their best, but they haven't had any mental health problems so they really can't understand how it feels. I feel like if I told them much more about what was going on they would panic, not really understanding how I can have certain thoughts but trust myself to look after it.  I have definitely gotten a much better relationship with my parents over the past two years after moving out. When I lived at home I was miserable and felt controlled and like I couldn't be myself. My parents didn't understand that, so they didn't actually want me to move out of home. They actually live pretty close to me, and from their commuting to uni would still be very easy. Because moving out was so much my own choice, they feel they don't need to support it, because I could just stay at home and they wouldn't need to pay more.  My dad puts $50 in my bank account every fortnight on his payday as a gesture. It covers a fair chunk of my groceries, but obviously rent is a lot more than that in the city! I've gotten a job offer which is nice. Hopefully, the trials will be good and not too stressful.  I'm starting a list of things I need to bring up in my appointment. I'd be happy to check back in after as well.  Hope you've had a good week.

                                    in reply to Innocuous     Hi Innocuous,  My parents are awesome - despite being overprotective of my etc. Like you there are things I have not told them but that is also because mum said she didn't want to know as it would make her worry too much about me (re suicide ideation), which is why I see a psychologist. I can understand my parents not "wanting" to know that part and have our boundaries.  Well done on the job offer. Hope it all goes well for you.Has that relieved any of the stress? Or did it create other things to worry about? (I would say that if you were offered a job they obviously thought you had the skills.)  Last comment on volunteering - near where I work there is a Op Shop, and community center - it is more of a case of know what is around you.  What are you studying at Uni?  I also create a list of things to talk about in my sessions - while I might read out the list, sometimes we get to talk about one item on the list. And good luck with your appointment.

                                    in reply to smallwolf     The job offer was a big relief. I am still stressing a lot (will they give me enough hours, will I be any good, will I make mistakes). I know I stress about it more than I should. Nearly everyone else in the world is able to work and doesn't make a fool of themselves in the workplace so there's no reason I can't. They obviously thought I would be good, but they also don't know about the anxiety/stress issues... I am honestly shocked I am having imposter syndrome for a minimum wage gig! I've been doing a lot of positive visualisation, imagining myself handling customers well and knowing the stock and everything which is helping me feel a bit more confident.  I'm studying human biology and anthropology at university. It's a really eclectic mix of subjects. I don't know what I want to do with it when I'm done. I'll end up with a double degree in arts and science, so there are a lot of options, but I don't have a lot of ambition with it. I'm half considering going on to do medicine but I don't know if I can stick with university that long. What did you study when you were at uni?  I haven't taken a list in with me to a psych appointment before. I don't really know how to bring it up. I actually feel like it would be kinda uncomfortable. I usually write one out so I have my thoughts in order but talking about it seems... too personal? I guess that's the point of psychs though, isn't it? I've never been really good about opening up in sessions. It's something I am trying to work on so I get the help that I need by focusing on the big problems. Something to work on.  ~ I         Mark this post as helpful           smallwolf  Community Champion                 3063 posts        17 November 2019

                                    in reply to Innocuous     Hi I,  the feelings you have of not wanting to make a mistake when starting a new job is natural - I would think that anyone who did not have those feelings a little odd. After all, a person wants to create a good impression with co-workers, new environment etc.  As for what I did at Uni ... started with Bach. of Science (Computing), then Masters. I have a BTh on hold and doing a counselling diploma at the moment. My path and ideas of life have changed... people are more important than sitting behind  keyboard writing code.  We each have our own ways of doing a session with a psychologist so whatever works for you. My lists are one line items. I find it easier to hand over a list to her than speak about some things. As for bringing it up, I don't. I just pass my phone over for them to read. The other reason I use a list is that I might have many things going on in my head so it stops me from sounding like a blubbering mess jumping between 10 topics at once. I hope that makes sense.  Last bit re the new job - might only be handling customers and stock but there will be skills you will pick up along the way. It might only be the practice with handling customers but that will help you over the longer term, whether you go into medicine or whatever else with your degree(s).

                                    in reply to smallwolf     Okay, so it's been a while. The induction shift and my first out-of-hours training for the new job went really well. I have my first proper shift tomorrow (it'll probably be more hands-on training as well). I can tell I am stressed by it because I have had pretty constant chest pain which is one of my symptoms of background anxiety. I'm still feeling good about it and staying positive, despite that little bit of stress.  My visit to the psych went well. I took my list in. I didn't feel comfortable letting her read it, but I used it to make sure I mentioned all the important things I needed to go over. It's definitely a something that I think I would like to keep doing so I can make sure sessions stay on track. I'd like to build up to letting her read it herself. I am a lot more honest on paper than I am out loud.  Thanks for all of your advice and for chatting with me about it all!

        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        Dimitra     5 posts        25 November 2019    I have been married for 11 years to a lovely kind man. We have two little girls. I am 48. It is my second marriage.  The first was when I was 22 and married a man who turned out to be violent (like my father) and a narcissist (like my mother). I married my now husband because he made me feel safe, but he definitely had a father energy about him. I have changed vocation in last few years, received success as a musician, connecting with people around the world through my music since the release of my album this year. I realised however, in my personal life I was extremely lonely and felt like I had nothing to look forward to except music. Parenting had also become very triggering (and healing). I started working with a musician who was just like me. Lonely, and needing love and understanding in a very particular way due to our common childhood traumas. We became close friends but when I realised I had feelings for him, I told my husband. I have moved out now 4 months ago but still am child centric in my daily life. My family of origin (parents ad sibling) have no contact with me as I have "muddied" the family name once again, and I have no friends for support as a result of the attachment disorder and the fact that most of the people I have been around are not real open types.  I am struggling. Every day I think about my options and both leave me sad and contemplating suicide. I feel I will never get out of this limbo. Damned if I do, damned if I don't.

                                    in reply to Jak88     HI Jake,  I recommend seeing a GP as soon as you can, so that they can write you a referral to see somebody.  If you are still using drugs, i highly recommend talking to the GP about this to and getting a referral to a treatment plan to help you give them up.  Whats happening with your partner sounds very difficult, and I'm sorry to hear that you aren't able to get her to understand how you feel, obviously fighting with her isn't helping, perhaps at a time when you aren't fighting try calmly telling her how you feel, describing how you feel in your body and your mind when you are experiencing anxiety, i hope that can help.  I would also highly recommend calling beyond blue for some phone counseling, but if you are in a heightened agitated state and you are worried that you might hurt yourself or someone else call 000 and get an ambulance to help you, that is what they are there for. As a side note I'm not sure what state you are in but if you are in Victoria get yourself an ambulance Victoria membership, it is worth every cent.  Best of Luck mate, i hope that you can get the help you need to live a happy healthy life.  Cheers  NM         Mark this post as helpful            Close

I already graduate my accounting degree from uni and I have over a year and a half of working experience in a casual accounts payable role (used to be 1 shift per week but it changed to 1 shift per fortnight because the business is slowing down.

                                    in reply to TheJackalRipper     Hi TheJackalRipper  Thank you for coming back to share your fantastic news, that is so very exciting that you have a job interview, well done.  Can I put something to you for you to think about ...you are not your depression, depression will not be having the interview next week.  TheJackalRipper will be, who has depression but is taking steps to manage it.  Try to think of it like if you had a broken arm next week, this would not impact who you are and how you present and how you answer the questions. Your arm would just be there with you but would not impact the interview.  I hear you in that you don't want to go to your interview depressed, on the day you might actually have some adrenaline going through your system, with excitement and perhaps some nerves too, that hopefully your depression may take a back seat.  There are some things you can do leading up to the interview to give yourself the best chance, not only with managing your feelings but also managing the interview too.  Interviews are a mix of finding out if you culturally will fit with an organisation and if your skill set will support the role, so perhaps doing some research on the company/organisation, perhaps seeing if they have some values that they support on their website, start to write down some of the things that you do or who you are that align with some of these values.  You can think about some of your character strengths that support their values.  By writing down some of your answers you can review them on the lead up to the day.  The way people interview now has changed alot and it does seem like more of a conversation that "tell me about your strengths", and "what are your weaknesses"...which is refreshing.  When I am interviewing I tend to look at a person's body language, how the sit in the chair and if they are upright and interested as opposed to slouched and disinterested.  Also knowing about their hobbies and what interests that they have outside of "work" so perhaps think about some on those things too, it is off putting to me if I ask a person about their interests and they say "ummm I don't know".  While it is true that outside interests should not impact the role, I also want to know that this person has things in their life that they do to enjoy life and to break from work life.  Even if you only have one or two things, that is fine, but talk with conviction, like you mean what you say.  I am not sure if this is helpful to you, happy to chat some more on this.

                                    in reply to TheJackalRipper     Hi Mate,  I got my first professional job in 2005 and on the day i interviewed I contemplated suicide, i felt like a worthless impostor who didn't deserve the role, but i got it.  I lost that job in 2007 through an organisational restructure and this was devastating to me, i never thought that i would find a good job again, but 6 weeks later, even though I had considered suicide on the day of the interview, I was again working in my field.  Since then I have interviewed a number of times and been successful on some occasions and unsuccessful on many more. I went into every interview feeling undeserving of the role even thought I knew I was qualified and could do the work.  What i have come to learn is that interviews are not really about qualifications, if they are talking to you they already know that you on paper have what they are looking for, they are about can you hold a conversation and put forward your ideas in a way that can be understood.  All interviewers know that interviews are stressful and they expect some anxious responses and behaviors, so don't worry that they are peering into your soul looking for darkness, because they aren't, all they really want to know is can you talk about your work in an understandable way and are you personable, which you seem to be.  You have the degree and you can do they work, even depressed, even anxious, you can do the work, so just focus on being friendly and presentable on the day of the interview, be nice to everybody you meet no matter their position and enjoy being able to focus on something that you absolutely understand, which is accounting.  Oh and on a side note determine where the interview is and how you are going to get there, where you are going to park your car etc before the day of the interview so that you don't have to worry about it on the day, and have your outfit determined the day before too, you don't want to stress about matching your shirt, tie and shoes on the day of your interview.  Best of luck with everything mate, be yourself, be mindful and present in the moment when you interview and then you will know you have given it your best shot.  cheers mate  NM      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful            Close
Topic: Help -feeling overwhelming thoughts   10 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        teaksea     7 posts        7 November 2019    Hi  Lately I've been feeling overwhelming thoughts of ending my life and they seem to be more regular and stronger I dont have a set plan but I am feeling like I am about to get out of controll and cant take another wave of emotional pain.  In this last year,I have lost 3 significant family members to sickness, I ended my marriage because he was emotionally abusive and then he got physical , and now he is preventing my daughter from seeing me by keeping her in another state and telling her I'm toxic .My business is sinking and I can't seem to shake these feelings off so I can be proactive . I don't even know what to prioritise today . I know things need to be done but I feel so exhausted as this has been going on for almost a year and at times I have been positive and hopeful ..tryed to move forward in various ways but then something happens like another death or no response from legal action or no hope of mediation with my ex so I can see my girl.  This whole situation is emotionally, financially and physically messy. How do people cope when there is so much to deal with? ..I've lost so much weight from worrying and lost friends because I isolate myself as they have been judgemental or don't have time or avoid me. I really just think the best thing is of I just disapear from everyone and everything now ..this seems logical in my head but I know it's not ... I am under so much pressure I just dont know where to start .  Advice on what steps to take or any strategies that have helped you will be welcomed .

                                    in reply to teaksea     Hi Teaksea  I am so glad that you have reached out, to get off your chest how you are feeling and try to clarify what you are dealing with each day.  You have so very much on your plate and I can hear how tired and overwhelmed you are feeling.  We are here for you, to chat with, to give you some hope and to give you some support in this really tough time.  It is so very brave of you to reach out and to start talking and I am so glad you have.  Can I firstly say that if you feel that you are in danger right now and that you are not safe please call an ambulance on 000. Lifeline is another amazing service that can give you some tools to get through now, they are on 13 11 14.  I am by no means a professional, just someone who cares and cares enough to say that you are worth it, your daughter loves and needs her mother and you are needed and wanted in this world.  You are under so very much pressure and hopefully chatting here will help that as well as chatting to some professionals, have you thought about a visit to the GP to see what they think and to get some help there too, they will be able to support you through this too.  Are there some things that you like to do. like reading or listening to music or singing or something that makes you feel happy and makes you feel good.  It would be so wonderful for you to do somethings that are for you and that talk to your soul.  It is such a stressful time and some relief from the noise in your head would be perfect.  I would love to be able to reach through and give you a big hug and just help you take a big breath and make this all better for you teaksea.  I am not sure if any of what I have said is helpful but please just take care of you, make those calls if you can and get some solid advice.  Hugs to you  AS      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           teaksea     7 posts        7 November 2019

                                    in reply to Aaronsis     Thank you AS from my heart. I cannot express how relieved I felt after reading your respose.  Your advice has been of great value to me as I really was slipping. I have now made an appointment to see a professional and you were correct in saying I needed to do something to help heal my soul pain for my girl . I think I was feeling so overwhelmed with the situation that I lost site of what is important..part of this is impatience that nothing seems to be improving or moving forward and part of it is greif for not being connected to my daughter and her everyday life and needs.  The fact that you reminded me to breath ..something so simple but so important and relieving. It is'the jolt I needed to make an action plan to stay above it all. Small steps hey ..  Thank you kindly again for your support and advice . Stay connected . love and light to you tonight .

                                    in reply to teaksea     Hello Teaksea  I am so very happy that I have been of some comfort to you, you are so very right in that you do need to be right so that you can be there for your daughter, it put such a smile on my face that you have made an appointment at the GP's to have a chat and get some further support, that is so wonderful.  Small steps are so very important, it does not matter how big or small just as long as you take one, and then another one, I totally understand what you mean by feeling impatient and I can hear how much you want your daughter in your life, of course you do.  Time will be your friend and you can afford yourself that time to focus on getting well and making additions to your life that bring you joy, so that when your beautiful little girl sees her mum she can she gets the very best version of you.  Well done and I am so happy you are feeling a little better.  I also noticed that you reached out to another BB person tonight and gave them some support, I just wanted to say how blown away at the level of comfort you gave them when you are struggling too, that is so selfless and shows what a wonderful and caring person you are.  I am here to chat and support you anytime teaksea, hope you are doing something tonight that makes you smile.

                                    in reply to Aaronsis     It's helpful to re-read your messages to keep me afloat during the
day. 1st day in while where I found a bit of clarity & bounce. Reaching out
to someone else in need was the right thing to do. I also found it comforting
not to think about my own problems for a bit.
I think managing self-care, high work demands, suicidal thoughts & grief is
going to need a visual updated care plan & systems. Updated cos I have been
self-managing these thoughts for some time but it obviously is not working so
whilst I wait for professional advice I need an immediate plan. I have been
self-reliant, it’s daunting to lean on others. The year has been nonstop
events. I thought, if I held on juggled things as they came at me it would
improve, but I guess I made a few poor decisions, prioritised in the wrong
order & lost it. Nights
are hard, sleep always fractured. I miss her so much I wake up in tears yelling
for her. A deep pain that’s breaking me in a way that I have never
experienced before. I feel like a cold stranger in my body, with family &
now friends/colleagues. This is usually a place of warmth. This the latest
thing that makes me want to let go completely. Immediate
Solution: Any suggestions? Maybe writing poetry as a release. I also need
to change lawyers as my current one is not progressing my family court case or
keeping me informed. High
stress work demands lead to panic attacks, negative thoughts about myself
/abilities. My brain is not functioning as sharp & is another source of
panic that I need sorted. Solution: Minimize tasks for 1mth to LIGHT ESSENTIAL DUTIES. Delegate tasks to
staff. Change negative brain messages to helpful. Give my mind time to rest
& prioritise (as you have suggested) getting “daily Joy". This morning
"joy" was a 2 hour long yoga/self-massage session. Bliss :) I feel strange, as I am going
through the motions of a living plan but at the same time I want to die. These
thoughts come in waves. I downloaded the "Beyond blue Safety Plan
App" it's given me peace of mind. Thanks
for the reminders to smile, take care of myself. Emotional/mind wounds on the
inside are not so visual, therefore make it harder to maintain a healing plan
as one would normally do with physical surface wound. I think I now have to be
very mindful that this needs regular dedicated attention, care &
treatment in order to heal. Cheerio
& enjoy your weekend AS.         Mark this post as helpful           aay_u     4 posts        9 November 2019

                                    in reply to teaksea     I hear you sister. Life is great then it’s bad then it’s ordinary but it’s perfectly imperfect.  I struggle with the darkness and my head blocks the light but I keep reminding myself it won’t last. For whatever reason some of us get so dark I can honestly say those of us that keep pushing through are the strongest of the strong. We need to believe that. The other thing that kept me going is my children now adults. My gosh the stories I could tell as life has been enormously difficult which makes me able to relate to many people. I think that’s the whole point is we are meant to help others going through a similar experience. We need to know we can do this and that life is a journey even if our journey is full of tests.  All our struggles even at the time we can’t realise but it’s meant to teach us a positive can come from darkness the hardest part is focusing on the big picture but one day soon enough it will become clear.  Your daughter will learn strength from her mumma and not to ever give up on hopes and dreams no matter how dark. She will come back to you one day when she’s older because every girl needs their mum no matter what their heads get filled with as we all want to see for ourselves, I know this better than most. So be the better parent and let the other parent be judgemental and nasty it will go against them in the long run but don’t give up trying to see her and keep a diary so she will see how much she means to you and how hard you tried to be with her but don’t degrade your ex in it she won’t want to see that as she will still love her dad no matter what.  Be kind to yourself. It’s ok not to be ok but don’t let yourself stay in the shadows of that dark cloud. Find things that gets you out of your own head, for me loud music, bright clothes, excersize, working, talking to others this is very hard at times because we like to lock ourselves away but it dosent matter if you cry or feel weak sometimes a good cry can help and sometimes a good friend can too. There are plenty of non judgemental people out here we just have to learn to be vulnerable in public to find them, dosent mean you have to bear your all but a good chat or a laugh can change your mindset.  You are important, you are loved and you matter. Here if you ever need a chat or an ear      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           teaksea     7 posts        11 November 2019

                                    in reply to aay_u     Thank you Ayy-u ,  Your words are comforting, give strength and perspective to me, which is really what I need. I can see that you have lived & experienced hardships, I hope life is kind for you now.  This is indeed a hard time & I understand that my ex is in pain after my decision to  separate and is lashing out at me in full force using my daughter . I don't think its acceptable or healthy especially to her or anyone involved to prolong the settlement & move towards mediation. He is doing my head in, but I genuinely want her to have a healthy relationship with him and would never degrade him. I fear for her emotional & physical safety as I believe he is not mentally stable & I know she is under a lot of pressure, which may lead her to taking life risks to which I am not close enough to monitor & guide, which makes me want to throw this job in, go delinquent on my financial loans and move to be near her immediately no matter what the costs & consequences may bey ..its hard to prioritise what to do because all roads lead to loss. Any way its a complicated situation & I feel as if I am gridlocked by his demands & behavior that sometime I get seriously  exhausted of having to hold it all together &  loose hope that things settle and move forward.  I'll wear something bright today, I think this is a good idea to keep the dark thoughts at bay. Thank you my sister for the love & light you so graciously share.

I am mostly so very happy to read that you downloaded the BB safety app, that is awesome and such a wonderful wonderful tool.  Healing is a journey and for some it is quick and for some it takes some time, I like to just take it one day at a time and put one foot in front of the other and then another, and then another, and that is what you are doing too.  I hear that you are still in pain and still suffer feelings of suicide but I am so very proud of you for speaking up and reaching out and having the app.  We are here for you and to chat when you need us and to cry with when you need to do that too.

Topic: Complex PTSD with disassociation. Getting worse despite treatment.   3 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        Bourky     1 posts        23 November 2019    Hi,  I am in my early 50,s. I have had depression on and off since my mid teens. When I was 30 I remembered some prolonged sexual abuse aged 8 and aged 11 to 13. (via catholic clergy). This set off an extremely self destructive period of substance abuse and risky behavior while in a same sex DV relationship. I became cut off from friends and family for many years and was only able to work occasionally . Over a few years I was able to rebuild my life so mostly, despite some anxiety and depression it was enjoyable. Good jobs---lots of travel friends ect.  I have always, mostly kept my parents down to occasional visits and phone calls until they both became ill 5 years ago. Since then the anxiety can get crippling so I am full of self loathing after visiting them and cant get out of bed for days on end. So, nearly 4 years ago I moved to an extremely remote location on the other side of the country and things began to improve again. I was able to work and support myself though I have remained anxious and socially isolated.  About 20 months ago I had a particularly bad shift that involved the death of a colleague who I was unable to save. That night I had a very brief flash back to what I thought was a recurring childhood night mare which I now understand is a terrifying memory from very young.Immediately after this unwisely I spent a few weeks at my parents as they were both unwell again. Since then I am unable to hold down a job for more than a few months.  I get triggered by the slightest bullying behaviour (or perceived bullying) that would otherwise have little impact on others. Dad is a shocking bully. The more someone is unpleasant to me the more I try to appease them. I never stand up for myself. I find it really hard to be around people at all now.  I have been seeing a great psychologist for the last 6 months who thinks I have complex PTSD with structured disassociation. In the last few weeks I have begun to come to terms with just haw sad my childhood was. Both of my parents could be quite cruel and manipulative . ....and continue to be. Much of my day for the last 2 weeks is spent feeling fearful and I think about suicide all the time.... though I have no intent.  Started antidepressants a week ago but may stop them due to the suicidal thoughts getting worse. Im on the verge of not being able to pay my bills/mortgage. The thought of working and my hands and feet become frozen and clammy and I end up in bed.  I feel so stuck. Any advice?

                                    in reply to Bourky     Dear Bourky~  I'd like to join Sophine_M in welcoming you here. It took a great deal I'm sure to make that first post (I had the  same hurdle as do most of us here, it is worth doing)  My PTSD, depression bouts and an anxiety condition came about for very different reasons and I'll not try to say much about that side of your life.  I can talk about parents. Abusive ones. I was eventually disinherited over a disagreement and found hte love I'd imagined had been htere n my childhood was just imagination, it did not really exist.  So we were separated, which I think was very good for me, thogh it took some gettng used to. There was guilt (undeserved) as well as loss and grief.  Very many years later I hear my father had returned to is country of origin and died there , with no communicator from him or those arond him to me. I found out another way.  This did sadden me. Later again I herd my mother, who was of advanced years, had cancer. I was now in two minds what to do, but eventually pity, not love, made me seek contact and try to be wiht her for her final few months.  Sadly the toxic person I knew in my youth was still just as present as before. My mother had learned nothing in her long life, and proceeded to lay very guilt and vituperation on myself and disparagement on my partner. I so nearly waled out so often.  It had an effect on me, closing off any lingering hopes matters might improve and raising again all the emotions of the original disinheritance. I should never have retried contact.  It sounds in some ways you are in a similar situation and the old thoghts and attitudes have take hold again. A bully remain one, and human nature -for some weird reason - allows the victim to feel guilt and failure - bullying causes so many injuries in all respects.  Please see your doctor now over the medication side-effects, which sound disastrous, and please also use a human  voice to help when overwhelmed. I personally suggest the Suicide Call Back Service (1300 659 467).   They are professional, realistic and a comfort. You can talk to the same therapist more than once without  tedious repetition. If they  are busy (they are pretty popular as they are so good, then Lifeline 131114 would be next.)  I hope you feel that you can come back here anytime, we do understand and would help if we can.

                                    in reply to CooperPatton     Dear CooperPatton~  Welcome back, I read your blank verse or poem or list. It gave a pretty clear idea of how you felt then, and things seem to have  been getting worse  As things do get worse the desire to try anything to feel better becomes irresistible . To get out from where you are, not deal with an unsympathetic family and few freinds makes one consider all sorts of things.  When feeling like you do it is hard to make decisions, and particularly hard to see consequences - NOW! becomes the important thing.  You may not feel like it but please bear with me. My option - which I took and which made the world of difference in time, was medical support, including being in hospital. I'll try to tell you why that was best.  So, homelessness. No showers so you have ingrained dirt, carrying all your possessions everywhere -even the public toilet (if they are actually open) to stop them being stolen, being  bullied and ripped off, in every way isolated and left with your own thoughts and no relief - not for me. If you want a sample ask to go to with a St Vincent's or similar food van at night and see what it is like on the streets. don't believe all the stories you hear from the homeless, just look at the people and judge for yourself  Being locked up, I was a policeman and I do not recommend it - I'll tel you why another time if you really insist  You have tried the obvious, weed, drink and even ciggies, no joy there  Medical help is better than any of these. Sometimes it is hard to get started down that road. So can I ask if you are withmedical care at the moment? If so it is not working and needs a review -which starts with you telling them how you feel.  If not, you are alone, then now would be a good time to start, Headspace may be nearby and have a time slot to get you started  https://headspace.org.au/headspace-centres/  If not book a long consultation with a GP, if face to face seems too hard, just show them a list and explain how close you are to hopelessness, or taking your life or any other alternative.  If you get overwhelmed before you can try these then ring the Suicide Call Back Service (1300 659 467). They are good -so the line may be busy. Professional, realistic and you can talk to a therapist more than once, a good deal, plus contacting them is no biggie, they only exist for you.  Hospital made a world of difference, not nice, but away from life, away from pressure. It helped me no end though I could not say that for everyone - but worth a try  Croix             Mark this post as helpful            Close

big one game isn’t it? Life. Life is all one big game. Everyone competing to be
known, to be happy, to earn enough money. It’s all a game in the end. Everyone
dies. Everyone dies in the end. I don’t see why we have to live this horrible
life, where life just throws all this rubbish and junk at you, and there’s
really no way to escape it is there? Life’s been pretty generous to most people. But not me. I’m not trying
to say my life is the worst and no-one lives worse than me. Cause that’s not
true. I know it’s not true. But it doesn’t mean my life is great. Cause it
really isn’t. It’s not at all. Life’s been pretty harsh to me. Nearly every day
it throws a new challenge at me. A new obstacle. A new thing to overcome. I
know what you say. You’ll say, I know you can get over it. I know you can pull
through. But I can’t. I really can’t. I think I can, and then the next moment
there’s a new challenge. And I can’t deal with it. Not anymore. I don’t want to
deal with this. I refuse. Why can’t I just give up. Why?  I want to. I really really want to. I
want to give up with this. I’m sick and tired of being me. I am sick and tired
of being sad all the time. I am sick and tired of being me all the time. I
am sick and tired of living. And I just want to let go. It’s never going to
end. It’s a life-long battle. I just want to give into
the constant temptation. I mean who would want to be me? I’m tired of being
ignored. I’m tired of the constant voices in my head, never letting me forget,
never letting me sleep. You don’t understand.
You will never understand. You will never understand what it’s like to
not be able to speak. What it’s like to never get a break from all this. What
it’s like to never know the truth. What it’s like to stutter over words, to be
laughed at for twitching when I get nervous. What it’s like to hate yourself so so much. What it’s like to feel like nothing.
What it’s like to be so dependent on every person, just to feel happiness
for a second. Then it goes. It never last long. I can never be happy. I mean,
what is happiness? Three years without proper happiness. I’m so done. Ok. I’m
done.  - Feeling Worthless         Mark this post as helpful           Sophie_M  Community Moderator            1396 posts        21 November 2019

                                    in reply to Feeling worthless     Hello Feeling worthless  I am so very glad that you have reached out in this time when I can hear how exhausted you are, so over it you are and so very tired.  I am not going to tell you to get over it, and that everything will be ok, chin up, just smile.....if that was the case I am sure that you and everyone else that is in pain and so very over it would have done it by now...that is really not helpful, but I am sure that people say that thinking that they are being helpful as they really don't know what else to say....  I would love to be able to reach out and give you a hug and just sit with you at this time, I don't understand how you are feeling and I don't know how to make it better.  If you are feeling like you are not safe at this moment can you please call 000 and ask for an ambulance, if you are feeling like you need some help just to get through now there are some amazing people at Lifeline 13 11 14 who can help you through this really hard time.  I lost my brother to suicide only a few months ago, he was 19, he expressed in his letter alot of what you are saying here to us know.  Can I say though that you are not alone, there are people who love you and you are wanted here and you are needed.  That there are ways to get through this time and it will take time and is not an overnight fix, but with help you can get through this time.  I don't know what it is like not to be able to speak, and to stutter over words, to be laughed at for twitching or to hate yourself so very much...what I do know is that ending your life is not the answer, it is never the answer.  We are here to support you and to care for you and to give you come comfort through this really shitty time.  I guess you are right in what is the meaning of this life..is it all one big game where we all compete against each other for a prize??? what prize...and yes..we all do die in the end.  I don't have the answer to that question but I think the meaning of life is that we are here, to make a difference, to live a life not always of smooth sailing, yes there are horrific challenges and some of us are hit harder than others.  Is that fair..no but hey...you know what...in all of this you continue to show up, to get up every day and live your life and despite all the shit that gets thrown at you ..you choose to live..that is so very brave and so very wonderful and so strong.  I hope that you come back to chat some more and to see that people do care, we are here for you.

                                    in reply to Sophie_M     Thanks for the advice but it's no use.  1. The beyond blue safety plan app glitched out on me and wouldn't let me open it.  2. I can't call anyone because my dad keeps watch of who I text and call and he would surely ask questions and want to know everything if he saw that I called a helpline.  You must be joking when you say I am needed and wanted here. I don't think so. Not at all.  I don't get why people call me brave; I am not in the slightest brave. I don't get it. How can someone so quiet and so stupid be brave?  I don't even get why I twitch, and why people decide they want to mock me for it. I've tried to just pretend they just don't understand, but they keep on doing it. Over and over. Why?

                                    in reply to Feeling worthless     Hi Feeling Worthless  I am so glad that you have come back to chat.  I am also glad that you have tried to download the app, even though it didn't load but you tried and that makes me feel hopeful that you will keep safe.  I just wanted to chat to you about your dad, if that is ok, you mentioned he checks who you speak to and he would be concerned as to why you would be calling a helpline.  Can I ask is that such a bad thing for him to be concerned and to want to help, the fact he is monitoring what is taking place on your phone shows a level of care.  Is there a reason why you cannot open up to your dad about how you are feeling and the challenges that are thrown at you daily?  I feel like your dad would be one person who would agree with me in saying you are worth it, and you do matter.  You are faced with so many challenges and people in this world can be so cruel and so very hurtful, I am so sorry that your stutter and twitches are means for people to make fun of you. I have no idea why, well I sort of do..by making the butt of the joke about you, it gives them 5 minutes break, so that the butt of the joke is not them, almost like a survival technique, cos if it is you they are focused on then it is not them, does that make it right, absolutely not, but does it make sense..sure.  I think also things that are unusual, like twitches and stutters, tourettes and handicap issues, people who are obviously "different", causes interest and people want to stare...I don't know why, ignorance in not knowing about the issue so if I stare a bit I can see it for myself...that sort of mentality...also..things too like I don't know how to respond to this person so I am going into "protection" mode and firing off, that makes me feel comfortable and it also makes me better than you.  Humans are so complex and none of this is right and none of this is fair and it breaks my heart that you have constant challenges thrown at you..undeservingly...it is so painful and I can hear how tired and over it you are, I can most certainly not blame you.  However, these people are not who you are and these people will not be in your life forever, you will find people who are understanding and who embrace you and love you for you.  Are there things that you have in your life that do bring you happiness?  It is ok if the answer is no...there is no expectation here, just a question.  I am just hoping you have some support as well as something even one thing that can make you smile.  Hugs  AS         Mark this post as helpful           2quik     74 posts        23 November 2019

                                    in reply to Feeling worthless     Hello FeelingWorthless.  I absolutely hear how beyond low you feel. I have been there so many times in my life and I am not saying that I do not go there at times now because I do. If you see some of my other posts on here, I tell a bit about my life. It is not for the faint of heart. I also know you say you are done and you have had enough. I have said that so many times too and I absolutely meant it 100%.  What I was done with and came to realise, I was done not loving myself and valuing myself for so many reasons that were not of my own creation all my life. I am still having to work so hard at loving myself and valuing myself. I have only just really tried to start at the age of 40 years old. My message that I am going to leave you with is to start some place in loving yourself and valuing yourself. Start small, even just the tiniest tiniest little thing, which might even mean just sitting and brushing your hair for one minute, It might mean throwing yourself into a heap of fresh leaves for a second, whatever that tiny tiny thing is. You do not have to feel better, you do not even need to feel happy doing it, you can even choose not to feel anything at all. hat is important is that you do it anyway. You get to choose and no you don't owe anyone an explanation for what tiny little things that you choose to do.  I also know that loving yourself and valuing yourself seems like a huge joke and what truly is the point of that? The point is that this is what is needed to change. I know you do not really want to leave this earth just yet. You think you want to and you think it is the end, but the end in truth is the beginning. The end of so many things you hate right now including yourself is only the beginning of of an ending. That time where possibilities seem endless and you get to dream for the first time. I know you see absolutely NO HOPE or point and the truth is there is actually no one that can force you to feel it or see it. No one could force me to see it or even believe it either so I have no intention of forcing anything upon you that no one could force upon me. At the end of every single day it was and still is up to me. At the end of each and every day this is all up to you. You are still here which is fantastic for the people that are going to meet you and the people you are going to meet. They are out there waiting to meet you and you need to get ready to go and meet them. It would be such a shame for that not to happen for you or for them.      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Feeling worthless     3 posts        24 November 2019

                                    in reply to 2quik     Thank you,  you made me smile, and gosh, I haven't done that in a while.  I get what you are saying, but they only problem is, is when I try to do something for myself their are voices in my head that decide that it's the right time for me to panic, and then the whole world spirals down again. I don't understand how everyone can be so calm, when it feels like the world's slowing crumbling around me.    Aaronsis (I'm replying to both of you in one message, cause I'm lazy)  I honestly have no idea why I can't talk to my dad, I feel like he's going to judge me, and just not really understand. He always says he understands but then what he chooses to do after he says that, shows me that he has no clue what I am trying to tell me. He's a logical thinker, in fact, my whole family, bar me, are logical thinkers. I'm the creative thinker, but being a logical thinker, my dad just wants to fix me, and he needs to learn that he can't do it.  - Feeling Worthless         Mark this post as helpful           2quik     74 posts        24 November 2019

                                    in reply to Feeling worthless     Hi again,  Thank you for replying. I smiled when I read that you actually smiled. It has made my day. RE: The voices that start which decide it is time for you to panic and your whole world spiral down again. I DO understand. I get those voices too. Most people would say ignore them and do what you want to do anyway, however it is not that cut and dry. What I will say is to listen to them, not engage in a dialogue with them, just listen quietly. Take a pause when it starts happening, just take a seat for a few moments, listen to them, write them down. When you see what is right in front of you rather than only being inside your head, it changes things. By doing this you bring awareness to those thoughts which you cant do in your head when you are in a panicked state. That is how you can slowly make some positive changes. It will take time and that is OK, be patient with yourself. I KNOW there are some really horrible thoughts in there renting a free space in your head, you can kick them out and get to choose what has a space to rent in your head or you can let those uninvited visitors stay.  much love your way.

                                    in reply to Feeling worthless     Hey Feeling Worthless, no need for apologies on replying.  I would just like to talk to you some more on what you said about your dad, firstly that is so wonderful that you can see that his line of thinking and feeling, as with your family is different to yours, that is great, that you can see that they would just want to "fix"you and that they can't do that....this is so much information that you have at your fingertips here and you can put it into place for them to help you.  You see sometimes we need to TELL people how to care for us and ASK them to do and say certain things, by doing this and having these conversations it is only positive in that they now start to collect tools that are actually helpful in helping you and you start to receive the help that is beneficial to you.  Everyone starts to feel worthy, and like they are making a difference.  Not everyone knows how to fly a plane...we have to be taught...not everyone knows how to bake bread...we have to be taught...same as mental health...we have to teach people how to help us.  This can start with a conversation as simple as "I have no idea how you can help me and I don't need you to fix me but can you sit with me while i tell you some things?"...please do not under estimate the power of conversation and the power of speaking.  I cannot answer if you father will judge you, I would tend to think not, however you cannot make this choice for him, give him the opportunity to help you.  With regards to your questions about how is everyone so calm....I am not sure we are, yet perhaps some are....it is that simple...perception is just that, think of a duck on the water, on top everything is still and soft and pretty and underneath those legs are going at 1000 miles an hour...that's how I mostly think people function, we look a certain way like we are calm but inside we have all sorts going on...we are all so different though but I would not tend to worry too much about others and just focus for now on you, and getting what you need to get your mental health in check and get on your road to wellness.  I am so very glad that you do try to do things for yourself, with regards to the voices, I think you can speak back to them and say "thanks, I will finish having this good time and we can chat later"....acknowledge they came to speak and then try to keep going with what is giving you pleasure, you deserve some peace.

My heart goes out to you in every possible way.

I keep having this thought that my grandmother used to always say ' the sooner it comes the sooner it's gone' .  I'm sure Sophie_M has contacted you and if you'll like we can talk each day or as much as you want to up until the day comes.  There is much more to your story as there is for me, but we'd love to hear back from you because that's far more important.  Please take care.  Geoff.

I have anxiety, which is getting worse and worse. I'm a interstate truck driver, so I don't have much time during the week to go get help. I am starting to have anxiety attacks to the point I have to pull the truck over and just cry, I have also had suicidal thoughts. I'm also afraid to get help because I don't have much time home on weekends and don't want to waste anytime because I already have lots to do on the weekends (that could be the anxiety talking).  Basically what I'm asking is how do I get help easily and quickly ? I know there isn't some magic medicine that would fix me, everything takes time but I don't have time and at times I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.

                                    in reply to TheBandit     Hi TheBandit  I am so glad that you have reached out here and that you have asked for some help at a time that you are feeling so emotional and tired, I can hear how desperate that you are. I am so proud of you for wanting help and for asking for help, that is so brave and a huge start.  There are some wonderful support services that you can reach out to, I hear that you are so busy driving but I think that you do need to make some time to address your mental health, it is so important.  You could start with a call to Lifeline 13 11 14, you could do that while you are pulled over on the side of the road, perhaps not while you are driving as you may be too emotional and you must stay safe on the road.  If you feel like you are in danger of hurting yourself please call an ambulance at anytime on 000, you matter and you are worth this life so please take care of you.  I do feel like a GP appointment is the way to go, they afterall are the only ones that can prescribe you medication if that is infact what they see to be fit for you.  I cannot make that call but they most certainly can.  If you just need some comfort and some support you can even call the Beyond Blue helpline, 1300 22 4636 who once again have some amazing people to talk to  and can support you through this.  I am so very happy to see too that you can identify that the noise in your head is potentially anxiety and that you are wanting to get some help, that is so great.  Please dont see the time in seeing a GP as a waste of time, it is your life and your happiness here and you are most certainly worth the time to get yourself back on track.  Please come back to chat anytime as we are here for you.

                                    in reply to TheBandit     Hi TheBandit,  Welcome to the forums and thank you for joining us.  I'm sorry to hear how much you are struggling.  I am though really glad that you're wanting to get some help although I can imagine with your job that it would be really difficult.  I absolutely think that this is the anxiety talking - while I believe that you have lots to do on the weekends, I wonder if you can shift that to 'I have to make time for this' ?  I know that by being here, you've already somehow set aside some time to create an account and post, and while that doesn't take as long as an appointment - it shows me that taking care of your mental health can be and has to be a priority.  It's probably worth remembering too that both GP's and therapists can see people both on weekends and after hours.  Phone support is available 24/7.  I hope that you'll find it in you to get some support.  It's hard to hear what you're going through but there are resources available to you.  RT         Mark this post as helpful            Close
Topic: Lets talk depression and other things   4 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        12345678910     2 posts        18 October 2019    Hi!  I'm going to keep this simple(ish)? to start with.  I'm in my early 30's, my background is pretty basic, I joined the military straight out of high school (year 10) (2005 - 2010), ended up in mining ( 2014 - 2016) and currently working a deskjob as a drafter.  I have been having problems with depression, anxiety and suicide for years. I didn't realise I had a problem until my late teens, prior to then I was oblivious to what was going on. Mid way through my military career I started to realise that things may not have been quite as I had expected. I had not at this point realised what was going on with my mental health, I never tried to straight up kill myself, but I regularly undertook activities that could have killed me.  Eventually my military career was over, I worked a few decent jobs until one day I was caught out in a drug test. This is late 2013, I figured this was the time to get clean and move on with my life. By get clean I mean moving to a "legal" drug.. I scored myself a job in mining, I spent 2 years there, I had a blast. But my drinking only got worse. I knew this was a problem, but it was really easy to ignore.  Mid 2016 I moved back home as the mining downturn was starting to really hurt the bottom line. But things never really changed. My previous 10+ years of depression and anxiety where still very prominent, but still easy to ignore.    Now I'm sitting here, thinking back to when I can first remember feeling like I didn't fit in, that something was wrong. It was my early years in primary school. But again its very easy to ignore.  In all this time I have never told anyone of my concerns. I know I need to but I just "cant"....  So this is the first time I have voiced my concerns to the public. Regardless of the replies to this i will probably do nothing about it, but its better than me talking to myself when i'm drunk... GG folks....    TLDR: Depression, anxiety and suicide starting primary school. Tried to kill myself a few times. Now just getting drunk cos its fun. Still think about killing myself, but I wont't cos I like my friends and family too much.       1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Croix  Community Champion            7625 posts        19 October 2019

                                    in reply to 12345678910     Dear 12345678910~  Welcome to the Forum, I like the way you have described your life, it sounds a practical understanding , plus of course the 'executive summary' at the end helps too.  Actually you sound a pretty capable sort of person, military, mining, drafting and the rest, someone who has abilities.  Also someone who thinks of killing them self.  OK I get the feeling that you are staring to feel that the problems are taking over, getting less easy to ignore, and despite what you say I also feel that if there was a path open to you to stop having these feelings and relying excessively on drink to get by, then you might take it.  People often take no action, until it is at crisis point, and I'm wondering why you do not use your capabilities to sort out what is happening to you, and has been for a long time.  You can explain well, do that's not it. In my own case it was a couple of things, the first the fear of being forcibly hospitalized, and the  second pride, thinking I simply was not one of those who needed care.  Maybe you worry what you would rely upon if you did not drink.  I found, when I finally did talk, that it eventually led to a much better and more capable life, with long-term accomplishment, satisfaction and love. I'm now good. Medical support was the way for me.  So may I ask what is holding you back? You say yourself you need to.  No answer is too deep, or silly or embarrassing, I've been there and will understand as will others here  Croix                1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           12345678910     2 posts        19 November 2019

                                    in reply to Croix     Thanks for the reply Croix!  Here I am rolling in almost a month after your reply.  I woke up the following morning from that post, unsure what I said. A common occurrence unfortunately.  I couldn't bring myself to see what any replies said so I didn't come back on here. I'm not sure what I expected?  Ill try to answer your question. Whats holding me back? Ill see if I can explain.  I have for the better part of my life been very independent. I have a healthy relationship with my family (parents, brother, cousins). I have friends that I regularly see and talk to, from school through to later in life.  But I really struggle to connect emotionally with anyone. There are these people in my life that I feel some attachment to, but I really can't connect to on an emotional level.  Everyone has always looked upon me as the stable one, the level head who can take anything and be anything. A fiction I have cultivated quite well over the years, with deficiencies I have hidden very well.    So whats holding me back?'  I lack emotions for a lot of things in my life. I should say that I lack the ability to express my feelings and emotions. I can't tell anyone because I have never expressed anything but good thoughts to everyone. Telling someone (that I know) that I have a problem in anyway just isn't something I could do.  Beyond that I have commitments to work that I can't affect....    I have re typed that last paragraph several times, but I don't know what to say.      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Croix  Community Champion            7625 posts        21 November 2019

I'm glad you have.  My main worry is those suicidal thoghts, which do not happen for no reason, and I guess are tied up in some way,  the same as your successful mask as Joe Cool, handle anything, when inside all is not good at all.  I have Depression in bouts, anxiety and PTSD, and I've had them for a very long time, they are now so much less of my life than they used to be, and while suicidal thoughts still creep in I handle them. I too had a mask until I was invalided out of my job.  That mask let things go along no hassles no questions, but kept me isolated, alone and becoming convinced waht was inside -me- deserved to be hidden.  Depression removed me from my emotions, to the extent I'd not feel, and that became a real worry as I came to beleive I could not feel.  All wrong of course.  Can I suggest you do go see a GP in a long consultation and talk about the suicidal thoughts, and the rest of your life. It is not as big a drama as you might think. Neither is telling someone close. I confided in my wife and she was amazingly strong.  So don't mix medical treatment and your work for now, see how things go.  Do you think I'm saying anything you can relate to, or am I way off track?  Croix                1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful            Close

                                    in reply to Ally1994     Hi Ally  Sounds like others have drained your incredible power out of you. No wonder you feel so run down, given all that's happened in your life.  Was thinking of the daughter of a friend of mine, just yesterday. She's now 20. She experienced challenge from a very young age. Her parents fought terribly oven the years. During this time she raised her mum as well as her younger sister. When I say 'raised', what I mean is every time my friend's ex would go through his phases of intense psychological abuse (which could last for hours), this girl would raise her mum up afterwards, so her mum could feel better about herself. During the fights, she'd raise her younger sister up out of the sense of fear by saying things like 'It'll be okay, I'll look after you'. She now suffers from terrible anxiety and depression and it leads me to wonder: Who raises those who work hard to raise others? Who helps restore the power back into the powerful people, when they've been drained?  Please don't feel bad about thinking your current thoughts about life. I thought the same thing at times. I stayed on this earth for my daughter and then went on to have my son. I'm glad I stayed. It was actually my kids that raised me out of depression some years back. My babies are now 14 and 17. Life is a bit of a seesaw with us. I raise them and they raise me. We challenge each other to go higher.  Can you think of all the different ways your son raises you? Maybe when he smiles, perhaps when he gives you a hug. What about when he draws a picture or says something that makes you laugh. Kids are so incredibly powerful in the ways they raise us, back into our true innocent and basic nature. To say to your son 'You have such a beautiful smile and a powerful hug, so powerful that I feel love' would raise him. To put his picture on the wall or the fridge or to say 'You bring me to life when you make me laugh' would have him on cloud 9. It really is like a seesaw. It's often about all the little things.  We deserve to be raised kindly and thoughtfully Ally. I believe we typically start life on a high, until others bring us down. Kids really are the key when it comes to showing us how to live again. Sometimes, this involves falling apart and then re-membering our true nature through their example. When our child leads us to smile or they lead us to feel challenged (to go higher), they are raising us. Even when their simple presence challenges us to stay and fight depression, they are raising us.  :)         Mark this post as helpful           Aaronsis  Community Champion            630 posts        19 November 2019

It is so great that you have found  yourself here, to get some support and some comfort and to talk about how you are feeling. There is no judgement here and no criticism, just support.  I am wondering how you would feel about seeing a counselor to get some professional support for the trauma that you have been through as a child and to help you get through this so as that you can help yourself not to get into the same trap and to break free from the past and to give your son the best version of you. Also being a single parent it tough and this is added pressure on you as well, you have so very much on your plate and it would be good to get rid of some of it and just purge.  It would be great to chat to you some more and see how you are feeling and help you through this time.

With everything that has happened to you your thoughts are natural and there is also a positive in your post - you were able to stop smoking pot. This shows a level of concern and love for your child. In that respect you are not as bad as you might think. And as Aaronsis said there are options.

I’ve been suffering from depression for years. Lately, it’s gotten to the point where I’m just so sick of myself and so tired of feeling sad and tired.  I don’t know what to do. I’m sick of being a burden to everyone. I can’t stand myself.  I was seeing a psych, but our schedules clashed to the point it wasn’t too hard to get to see her.  I’ve got to keep going as I’ve got my small family, but to be honest, I can quite understand why people just give in. It’s too much some days.  That’ll do for tonight.

Topic: i need some tips on how to get better, because i’m kind of a mess   6 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        elsielle     3 posts        18 November 2019    Hi, I’m new here, and I should have come somewhere like here earlier before things have gotten out of hand, but I’m trying now.  I first had depression when I was 14, my friend was emotionally abusive... I also self harmed... my parents found out, and I talked to my aunty who is a mental health nurse, but I never saw a fully qualified mental health professional. I was fine last year, but this year it has returned, and is worse then what it was.  Some days I wake up and cannot move, it will take so much energy just to stand up. This also happens randomly throughout the day, and there have been multiple times where my body seems to forget to breathe and I have to force myself to. I find it difficult to talk to people on the days when it’s really bad, it’s like there is nothing inside me but endless black. My depression also takes a physical form as what I’ve dubbed the ‘shadow man’- I know this sounds dumb, but I want to be honest about what I’m experiencing- who sort of overshadows me, and sometimes I get bad headaches, where it feels like someone is squeezing my head. I know this is probably just my imagination, but it feels real. I also struggle with sleep; most nights I get 4-5 hours,as I’m afraid to sleep for too long due to vivid realistic nightmares if I do.  I also struggle with anxiety- it takes me a long time to trust people and make new friends, as I have had my trust broken a lot in the past by people. Though some of these incidences were from primary school, and my parents tell me I should just move past it, I can’t seem to open myself up to others. I overanalyse a lot, and feel like I’m constantly annoying my friends, or that they keep me around out of pity.  Overall, I feel lost and helpless at the moment. I don’t feel comfortable talking to my parents about the full extent of what I’m going through, because they don’t really understand properly, and they already had to work with my sister to help her anxiety, so I don’t want to be a burden on them, and make them feel as if they messed up somehow. I had a panic attack in front of my mum yesterday as well, and her idea of comforting me was to give me a hug and tell me that I needed to calm down, which basically sums up the extent of their ability to provide support.  Sorry for how long this was, I hope someone responds... if you have any advice, tips, etc, to help my mental health improve, it would be really welcomed.

                                    in reply to elsielle     Hey Elsie,  Sorry to hear the tough times you are going through. i will say i have the same experiences as you, head feels like its squeezing, cant get up, nightmares and i'm sure there are plenty other people on this forum who are having similar experiences.  I am young (16) and haven't experienced most of my life yet, but i can say, i had a friend for 8 years. we did everything together, then when it came around to high school, we started having different interests. I preferred gaming and staying indoors (Im autistic btw find it hard to socialise) and he preferred being outside and doing sports. Then he got a new friend, who had similar interests to him and started saying abusive stuff to me, like it was just casual conversation for him. we had a huge fight and i ended up getting humiliated in front of all his friends and other people.  i ran, and didn't look back. I was so upset and miserable, my only friend, gone. I self harmed after this occurrence as i went into a huge mental breakdown, but i came here, to talk about my problems, and it's probably one of the best decisions i've ever made. And to that extent i also made new friends who do have similar interests to me and really truly care about me. The world is a scary place, my brain is always coming up with ways to give me a panic attack. But i've learnt to use strategies to cope with it and it makes it a whole lot easier. Maybe if we could hear more about your life we/I can provide more assistance.  You're not alone and we/I hope to hear from you soon  Stay safe :)  BL         Mark this post as helpful           Whatever1     2 posts        19 November 2019

                                    in reply to elsielle     Hey elsielle.  I understand what you are going through, I’ve been there. Things that really helped me through my depression are, I moved away and lived with my aunty and uncle for a year or so, it was far away from the rest of my family but I was in a new environment and I met new people. It was hard at first but I became to really like it, it was a beach town and it was always warm. While I was there I got a lot of mental health medical assistance seeing a counsellor twice a week and a dietitian once a week. I was put on medication, I was very anti medication when it was first introduced to me but as I got more educated I saw the advantages in it. It took a while to get use to but it was extremely helpful. Me and my therapist came up with a lot of tools to use when I feel I wanted to self harm. Things like elastic band around your wrist, holding ice, drawing on your self (with texta or markers) where u are wanting to self harm. All these tools because really helpful and the constant sessions with my therapist I started to notice a difference and also being on medication. I felt so much more light and enjoyable with my day to day activities, lots of people noticed differences too. Exercise was also a big part in my recovery it kept me going I found it something to look forward to and something I was proud of when finished. Please never give up and give things ago even if they don’t work for you or some of them are unable to be available for you just try because there’s no harm in trying. I am still on my medication today and I have been on it for 3 years now and I’ve up the dose of it also.

                                    in reply to Ben.L     Hi Ben,  Thanks a lot for sharing your story with me, I’m sorry you had to go through all that. I’m glad you’re moving out of those dark places, and hope I can start to. You asked me to share some more of my life experiences, so I might talk about my past friends etc.   When I was 3, I made a friend I was inseparable with. We were always hanging out, etc. It was like this until we were 12, when another girl started trying to cut me out of my best friends life. Similar to your situation, my friend was sporty and popular, whereas I’m more interested in reading, etc. I didn’t really notice it at first, but this other girl came between us, and worse my best friend didn’t realise, until I stopped hanging out with them because I couldn’t stand being ignored anymore. My friend got upset and asked why I left, but when I tried to explain what was happening from my pov, she couldn’t accept the other girl had done anything wrong, and tried to pin the blame on herself, then ended up blaming me. I acknowledge we were both were at fault in certain ways, but it left me unable to let anyone get close to me again. I still keep people distant, because I am afraid of being as hurt as I was then.  The second incidence was in year 7/8. When I started high school I only knew a friend of a friend. This girl and I became close, but it was more from her side, as I was cautious. Then at the end of year 7, her true colours came out. This girl was spoiled at home; I’m not sure if that’s where it stemmed from, but she expected everyone to listen to and do as she said, or else she spreaded nasty rumours about you, and as her mum worked at the school, you would get in a lot of trouble regardless if they were true or not. The things she did started off small, then began to become so invasive I developed depression. She cheated off my work, and made me do her own. On camp she made me take my phone so she could talk to her mum, but wouldn’t get in trouble for having hers. She repeatedly took it and other things from my bag without asking, even when I told her not to, and rarely gave them back-this also happened at school. She said horrible things about the other girls in the group, and would talk about them behind their backs. She left the group in year 9, but still acts like we’re friends sometimes . I feel scared/anxious when she talks to me, as it brings it all up again. I’m moving schools next year though, so I don’t have to see her anymore.   I hope this clarifies some things:)  Elsie         Mark this post as helpful           elsielle     3 posts        19 November 2019

                                    in reply to Whatever1     Hi Hannah,  Thank you for sharing with me, your story is really inspiring and I’m glad you are in a better place now. Some of your tips sound really good, I sometimes draw to relieve my stress anyway but I think actually drawing on myself would be a lot more helpful. I’m moving to a new school next year that is a longer distance from my house as well, so that change of scenery may also maybe help me if you found that worked :)  I would like to see a therapist, but I’m too scared still to tell my parents, and as they don’t really understand mental illness that well, and some things they actually do more harm than good for me. I’m also scared to try medication, I’m glad that it worked for you though, and if it’s like you said then I might be more willing to look into it.  Thank you once again for responding, it means a lot to know that people care, and for giving me some helpful advice.  Elsie         Mark this post as helpful            Close
Topic: Emotional problems and distant family   3 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        Anna-Connor     7 posts        19 November 2019    Four years ago, my mum died and all of a sudden it was like everything was thrown into this new perspective. The family that I thought had always been so close and supportive, suddenly became this group of people who didn't actually talk about anything of substance. I don't know if it's always been this way and I never noticed, or if it was my mum's death that kind built this distance between us. Regardless, gradually I started to feel sad and angry a lot, I didn't know if it was because of what happened, or the distance, or something else, I couldn't explain it, I just knew something was wrong.  I tried to talk to my family about it, but my dad instantly thought it related to my mum and wanted to send me into counselling. I didn't want to go, so he decided the next best option was to pretend I hadn't said anything. In all fairness, I didn't bring it up again either.  I reached out to these forums after that, and some of the advice I got made me feel better, and my emotions started to become more regular and more manageable. I thought I was getting better. But, f or a while now, I've been feeling angry and sad again, I can't seem to control it, and it's triggered by the most inconsequential things. My family think I'm overreacting and I don't know how to explain to them why or what's going on because I don't even know. It's not fair on them that I get upset so easily sometimes. I've tried to talk to them, but it's hard, it's met with pity, judgement, or a general 'get over it' attitude.  This just makes the distance between us worse, they just treat me with indifference now, I get ignored so often, sometimes I speak or ask a question and no one even looks at me. Just a week ago I finished my four-year bachelor degree and not one of them congratulated me. My dad hasn't even acknowledged it yet.  I just feel so lonely and so neglected sometimes, but if I talk about it, it makes it worse.  I started self-harming when it all started coming back (only superficially, nothing serious) because it was the only way to get my mind off whatever insane emotion I was feeling at the time. I still do it, and I know I shouldn't, but I have no other outlet. I feel like there's no one I can talk to because I'm just so scared of judgement and being ignored and making this distance so much worse. I just want my family back but it seems like no matter how hard I try, I just end up making things worse.  I don't know what to do, I don't want to keep feeling like this.

                                    in reply to Anna-Connor     Hello Anna - Connor  I am so very sorry that you are feeling ignored and that your family have not acknowledged such a wonderful achievement that you have been able to credit to yourself, well done, that is wonderful and it would have taken so much study and dedication and strength to get through, especially seeing that your mother's passing would have been happening at this time too and you are grieving.  You are so very strong.  I can hear how sad you are and that you just want your family back, it is so very painful when people all sort of disconnect and go their own way in the grieving process, we are here for you and I am so pleased you have reached out to get some support and some comfort.  I can understand too that you feel like talking about it sometimes makes it worse, I think this is because it drags it all up again, but it really is good to get it out and also to share how you are feeling with someone so that they can care for you and give you some comfort.  I am worried that you are self harming as a means of managing these feelings and as an outlet to your pain and frustrations and to let the emotions out, would you consider making an appointment at the doctor to discuss these things and how you are feeling and to get some help.  I really think it would be beneficial to you and they could also get you in touch with some counselling, I know, not exactly what you want but it may just help you.  Also can I say that we are always here and that i would love to chat some more and get to know you and how we can support you through this time, perhaps when you are feeling like you are going to hurt yourself you can come here and chat to us and let it out, if you feel like you are in extreme danger of hurting yourself please please reach out to Lifeline on 13 11 14, they have some wonderful people who can help you through these times.  I am so very sorry you are going through this and that you are feeling the pain of your family all on different islands and just drifting apart, it is sad and maybe it is all part of your mum's passing and maybe it has always been like this but I can hear how much sadness it is bringing to you.  Big hugs to you Anna - Connor and I hope to chat some more to you.  Hugs  AS         Mark this post as helpful            Close

                                    in reply to Sad.girl101     Dear Sam~  No it is not too deep, it is something others here have had to live with , so we understand. Having freinds, not being poor, a lovely BF and all may seem sort of irrelevant to you, the desire to not be here can take over. I felt like this and no way out. It kept getting more and more. Like you I too tried, more than once, to take my life, but circumstances intervened.  Saying you are ok, that mask that divides you from others, is understandable. I did that too. It was so much easier than putting up with meaningless questions and seeing other upset. It took me further away, as I hid my real self I came to believe I needed to hide it becsue I was not worthy or pleasant. After all if I had to hide myself then I must be bad enough to need to hide.  Caring for your friend is great, but you do need to talk and be with those that understand . I found my best friend, my partner, much stronger and more capable than I'd thought. I could lean on her.  May I ask if you have proper medical support at the moment, people who realize how you really feel? That was  what I needed though for years I thought that was to be avoided..  It may be a silly question too, but do you have any idea why you feel like taking your life? You may not know, I did not, but then again you might have an idea.  So what to do? I ended up trusting my partner and a psychiatrist and went into hospital. Not the most pleasant experience but it did me a lot of good. I'm not saying it suits everyone, but for me, being away from life, isolated and removed, was a great help.  I could look out the smoker's window down several floors to see foreshorten people going about their lives, pigeons  flying from shrub to shrub, and I did not have to take part.  I found books, easy ones to start with , adolescent fantasy, given to me be a kind psych nurse, and I lost myself in them -still do.  What can you lose yourself in? Something you can look forward to?  I've talked about me a lot in this post, and I've done so in order that you can realise firstly there are others like you, and secondly there is hope. I am in a pretty good place now with love, ability, accomplishment and able in my turn to give support.  I hope to talk with you again  Croix            1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful            Close

I and in year ten a school and I'm doing two VCE subjects. I have always been very conscientious and worried about my marks, which hasn’t really been a problem because I mostly get As and do well anyway, but recently it has got a lot worse and if I don’t get 95% or above, I'm not happy with how I did and I get very upset. I know that nothing really matters until year twelve, but I can’t stop worrying before and after tests.  Exams start in four days and I'm so stressed about studying and how I'm going to go that I have recently got to the point where I'm crying every night and I started self-harming. I never thought I would get to this point but now that I have, I don’t know what to do and I don’t want to stop because it helps. I haven’t told my parents or psychologist yet and I don’t know how to either.  papercranes          Mark this post as helpful           Aaronsis  Community Champion            630 posts        11 November 2019

                                    in reply to Papercranes     Hello Papercranes  I am so glad you are here and you have reached out for some support and some comfort at this really tough time.  I am not a doctor just a person that cares about you.  Exams are stressful and I can see that the results that you are getting are determining how you are feeling about yourself.  Can I say that you are not your results and that these results are a reflection of a moment in time, when you sat the exam.  They are by no means who you are or what is inside of you or the definition of you.  I understand that they are important and you want to do well, that is wonderful, however they are not who you are.  I am concerned that if you have started hurting yourself that it might be time to talk to your parents, you said you haven't talked to your psychiatrist, does this mean you already have one or that you think you might need one? sorry I was a bit confused on that one.  You are so much more than your results Papercranes and I just want to let you know that at anytime you don't feel safe or you feel like you might hurt yourself please talk, to either your family or if you can't you can call Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800 they have some beautiful people that have tools to support you through this time.  Please take care Papercranes and I would love to chat to you some more.  I hope I have been able to support you tonight, hugs to you.

                                    in reply to Papercranes     Hi Papercranes,  Except for what you have written in your post, I know very little about you or your situation. However one thing I am quite familiar with is your need to get good marks - it is something my own father had to contend with, I struggle with, and so does my daughter all strive(d) for perfection and I think in each case for different reasons. Yet as Aaronsis says your mark(s) do not define who you are.  There are also alternatives to self-harm which you could look into -
squeezing ice cubes, etc. You will find other possibilities on the
beyond blue forum. On telling your psychologist or parents.... you were able to put it in writing here which takes courage in itself. Perhaps you might be able to take a copy of your post (without your handle attached) and show it to your psychologist? Experience has told me such conversations are difficult.  I don't know how your parents would react, yet the fact they do not seem to have any issue with you seeing a psychologist, I would think/hope they would only respond with love and concern and compassion if they knew the how this was affecting you.

I was going to tell my school psychologist the other day, but I couldn't bring myself to. I also haven't told my parents, partly because I don't know how to, and partly because I don't want to worry them. Exams started on Friday but instead of feeling really upset and panicked, I just feel numb. I have been trying to stop self-harming, but it's sort of addictive and I've kept doing it because it breaks through the numbness sometimes.  I've been wondering, is everyone like this? I can't remember a time when I wasn't worried about my marks or what everyone else thinks of me. If everyone else also has the weight of doubt and anxiety hanging over their heads constantly, how do they pretend to enjoy life? What is it like to not be constantly paranoid about what everyone else thinks of you?  Sorry, I'm using this as a place to vent.  papercranes         Mark this post as helpful           Sophie_M  Community Moderator            1396 posts        17 November 2019

                                    in reply to Papercranes     Hey Papercranes, We are so glad to see you are continuing to use the forums to seek support. We think this is a really positive thing for you to do be doing and we hope the forums have been helpful for you so far. We are concerned to hear that you are continuing to self-harm, as this is a dangerous way of managing stress. We would recommend reading through the Beyond Blue webpage "Self-harm and Self-injury" for advice on how to replace self-harm with something less harmful: https://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/suicide-prevention/feeling-suicidal/self-harm-and-self-injury We would also recommend getting in contact with Kidshelpline. They offer 24/7 counselling for those under 25 years and are available by calling 1800 55 1800 or visit https://kidshelpline.com.au/  We also think it's important to tell your parents and psychologist about using self-harm to cope with your anxiety, as they would be able to offer you support and help to alleviate some of your stress. 

 We hope today has gotten a little better for you since you posted and we look forward to hearing back from you.      1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           Aaronsis  Community Champion            630 posts        17 November 2019

                                    in reply to Papercranes     Hi Papercranes  It is great that you have come back and that you are using this place to vent, it is great that you feel you have a place to come and to chat and feel some support.  Exams are stressful and I think most people have a certain level of worry that they want to do well, I think that is our bodies natural response to pressure and being tested and wanting to perform well.  I am concerned that you are self harming though and i would like to see if you can bring yourself to chat to your parents.  Please do not see is as worrying them but instead informing them and then letting them do their role of loving and caring for you and giving you some extra support, to be parents to you.  They will be concerned, of course they will, but they will be ever so grateful that you are talking to them and letting them know that you are struggling right now and need some help.  I think if you are worried or don't know what to say, you can always show them what you have been communicating here so very well, getting out your feelings and how you are seeking some comfort.  They can perhaps make an appointment for you at the doctor and help you to get through this time.  You have opened up to us and shared how you are feeling and if it is painful to go through it all again with parents, with doctors, showing them this post is a great place to start.  Big hugs to you today and it is so brave of you to come back to chat, I wish you every bit of strength to open up to your parents too, they love you.

                                    in reply to Papercranes     Hi Papercranes,  I hope exams are going/went well! Don't apologise for using this place to vent - that's exactly what it's for! And it's a really healthy and helpful outlet for your feelings so I hope you keep it up.  What you have described doesn't sound like what most people deal with. Yes, exams are a really stressful time and a lot of people do get very overwhelmed, but it sounds like you are having an extra hard time dealing with it. Self-harm is quite serious, so I hope you'll check out some of the sources that Sophie mentioned and keep yourself safe. Therapy or talking to a counsellor is a scary step but it might help you to start with some online or phone counselling to start with. They can talk to you about what you're feeling and give some advice on how to manage your stress or how to talk to your school counsellor.  I didn't talk to my parents about my mental health for a long time. I waited until I was out of school and looked for treatment myself. But I really wish I had been more open with them. Looking back, I realise I would have really benefitted from some form of treatment starting a lot earlier. When I did tell them, they were worried. But not because I didn't tell them, or because it was going to be a burden on them. They were worried because they love me and want me to be safe and looked after. An open and honest conversation, when you know they aren't already stressed or busy, is the best way to do it. Or you could try writing them a note or a letter and asking them to read it.  I hope you look after yourself, and let yourself relax when exams are done. Remember, you've done the best you can given your own situation, and that's all you can do. Be proud of yourself for making it this far.  Best of luck,  ~I      2  people found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           smallwolf  Community Champion                 3063 posts        17 November 2019

                                    in reply to Papercranes     hi Papercranes,  It is ok to vent in this space. We may be anonymous yet we can try to understand some of the pain that you must feel. When I was in high school (too many years ago) I was very self conscious, easily embarrassed, trying hard but never quite achieving. One teacher said "these are the best days of your life". I did not believe him then. It took another 30+ years to finally get help - I thought that some of what I was feeling was normal. Well, it was for me, but not for everyone (?) else. Recently I have had odd good day, so I know what it could feel like. But I cannot fake being happy.  Other than seeing a psychologist and various tips and tricks I have learnt, related to the 2 talks by Brene Brown - one was a TED talk and the other was a follow up talk on shame. One thing she mentioned was a small sheet of paper with the names of those people whose opinions matter to her. Nobody else.  With everything I or others here go through, it is knowing that we cannot change our thoughts like you might cook instant noodles - it takes time. And sometimes things can be too hard to talk about, and as you get more comfortable talking to someone else, or writing here, it will get easier for you also.  Lastly, on telling your parents (or not) ... a real story - somebody I know has 2 sons. The father is strict, self centered, puts down others quite easily. One of the sons was not feeling right and it was noticed by one of the school teachers. The mother took the son to their GP where for some reason said that he felt worthless. Suffice to say mother was shocked by this statement and other the child made. The statements would obviously go back to the father. There was a 180 degree turn in his behavior towards his son(s), showing care and compassion regarding how his son felt. Parents do not want to see their children hurting.  One christmas (when I was in my teens) I had a question for my parents and I was too embarrassed to ask it so I wrote on a sheet of paper and gave it to mum. It was my way of starting a conversation.  There will come a time when you will be ready to talk to someone - you have already started here, which is brave and courageous in itself.

Topic: New here, should I see a psychologist?   4 posts,
        0 answered    Oldest first  |  Newest first       Cancel        Piggy_1234     2 posts        15 November 2019    Hi,  First time posting, not sure is this the right place to start with as I have never seen a doctor/psychologist for my case or taking medication.  I am an international student (Asian background) studying at uni, been in Aus for 6yrs so feels like home. I really enjoy my time here.  Long story short, I grew up with strict parents that I often felt lack of freedom. Their arguing noise and violent behaviour at home often accumulated my anger that I have to grind my teeth and make myself in pain to control. Moreover, my parents also compare my academic results to my sibling so I feel very low self-esteem since my grades are usually "just passing". Many nights in the past, I have asked myself my purpose of living (which I still have no answer nowadays). I often feel worthless and hopeless as I am not good at anything and I don't have the purpose to live, staying in bed thinking of suicide.  Since moving away from my parents, things have improved a lot and these negative thoughts and anger are less likely to appear. However, whenever it's exam time, the stress started to build up badly that those negative thoughts would just keep coming back every semester (usually a week before the exam) along with multiple diarrhoea. The situation wasn't too bad for the last few years until recently (my final semester at uni) with an OSCE exam and 4 assessments that all due within a week. Since a month ago, my stress has built up so badly that I felt I have been trapping into a vicious cycle with stress, anxiety, self-blame, anger, break down, self-harm & suicide thoughts, insomnia, fatigue for the whole month, along with nausea, headache and many times diarrhoea. Every few days I would be thinking of making myself to bleed as punishment or killing myself because I feel like "everything will come to an end if I do it". I can hardly sleep and wake up every morning with anxiety, and also rarely feel hungry but forced myself to eat.  Throughout years, I have been feeling tired of living from time to time, but especially these days I feel like I am at the edge. Despite I have submitted most assessments & exam, I am overwhelmed with my grades as I am worrying I will fail. I don't think I can deal with these again if I need to repeat the units.  I have reached out to my close friends before, they suggested me to see a psychologist. Is this somewhere I should go and seek help? I know this is not the first time and will not be my last. It always comes back when I am stressed. Thx!!         Mark this post as helpful           Sophie_M  Community Moderator            1396 posts        15 November 2019

We are really sorry to hear about your past experiences at home and that you are going through a tough time right now. We think it would be beneficial for you to reach out to other support services including the ones we have listed below.  Please remember, if you are in immediate danger to yourself, always call 000.  You can contact Suicide Call Back Service when you are thinking of self-harm and suicide, on 1300 659 467  These are crisis supports for if you become a danger to yourself again. However, we strongly urge you to access ongoing support. You can access support through your GP, or through a variety of other services which can assist you.  We would recommend you call the following services for support and assistance, even if it is to talk through how you can access further support:  Headspace: https://headspace.org.au/contact-us/ Kids Help Line: 1800 55 1800 Beyond Blue Support Service: 1300 22 4636        1  person found this helpful   Mark this post as helpful           smallwolf  Community Champion                 3063 posts        16 November 2019

                                    in reply to Piggy_1234     Hi,  Sophie_M has provided some good links which you would benefit from looking at.  I would point you to the K10 test on the BB web site...  https://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/anxiety-and-depression-checklist-k10  - a simple checklist aims to measure whether you maybe affected by depression and anxiety and the higher your score, the more likely you are to be experiencing depression and/or anxiety. You can print the results for your records or to give to your GP.  That was where I started. I am not saying your friends are wrong, and it is better to be safe than sorry.  You could always have a chat with counsellors at Uni which should be a part of student services - they might be able to give you ideas or ways of moving forward.  I also feel hear your frustration and sadness in being compared with your siblings - I compared myself with others in my family, feeling like I never got there, trying but not succeeding. Yet we both got into Uni, so that should be seen a positive. And from your post you are also passing - I am interested in your idea or "just passing". You are also living independently. So there are a number of things in your favour.  Fwiw - I did fail one subject when I first went to Uni. In fact, I did not make it to Uni after high school. I think the subject was an elective as I cannot recall doing it again. I know that failing sucks and damages your GPA, and it takes me 30 years to learn this -> there are positives in failing. With that said I hope you do pass.  You have made to the end of your degree. from the sounds of it - another achievement. I hope you come back and share a little more of your story.

I should be safe for now as I submitted all my assessments and exam is over, but the wait of results are overwhelming. Despite everything has finished and I should be in holiday mode, I don't feel any happiness or relieve at all. Still worrying whether passing or failing.... Failed too many units already and repeat many subjects in academics.  I hope the GP will help me after all.... Finally decided to make an appointment.
